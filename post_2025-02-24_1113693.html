If you wear both shoes for seven days, and then return one of them before the deadline, that&#x27;s no different from the OP.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@alexsz 若同时购二履以试，不合则退，此乃面试，非试用期也。若二履皆穿七日，期满前退其一，则与楼主之举无异。</details></li><li>@milala #2 Then you should post the company name.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@milala #2 宜公之司名，以儆效尤。</details></li><li>I think the existing leadership and HR should be eliminated. This approach is completely lazy and bad. Recruiting should be about recruiting the right people who meet the requirements. From the interview to the probationary period, everything should be about examining whether this person meets the requirements, meets the job requirements, and if they meet the requirements, they should be retained. If the interview and probationary period cannot be examined, and only the last-place elimination can be used to select the best, then the leadership should just leave. If they don&#x27;t have this ability, what kind of leader are they?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>窃以为，当汰现领导层与人事。此法实乃懒惰无能。招贤纳士，应求适格之人。自面试至试用，皆当察其是否胜任，满足岗位之需，合则留，不合则去。若面试试用皆不能察，唯靠末位淘汰择优，则领导者可径去矣，无此能，何以为领导？</details></li><li>@matrix1010 Not rational at all. &quot;Ensuring high talent density&quot; requires very reasonable interview strategies, high-level interviewers, and sufficiently good salary levels to ensure it. Last-place elimination is a very lazy decision-making method. Either the priority of &quot;recruiting&quot; is placed too low, or people are used improperly. For startups, getting caught up in these two things is not far from death.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@matrix1010 殊为不智。“保人才密度”者，需合理面试策略，高段面试官，佐以丰厚薪酬。末位淘汰，实乃偷懒之策。或“招人”位序过低，或用人不当。创业公司若沾此二者，气数将尽。</details></li><li>Didn&#x27;t the OP say that the company name would immediately expose themselves? What is the mentality of scolding people?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>楼主岂非言明公司名即自曝其身？骂人者何心？</details></li><li>Post the company name.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>公之司名。</details></li><li>I&#x27;ve encountered it, I left directly.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾亦尝遇，遂遁。</details></li><li>Was there reasonable compensation? If it&#x27;s unreasonable, directly arbitrate.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>赔偿可合理？若不合理，直诉仲裁。</details></li><li>My company, but compensated 1 month.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾司，赔一月矣。</details></li><li>Directly ditch them and don&#x27;t go.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>径弃之，不往也。</details></li><li>OP is so miserable.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>楼主甚惨。</details></li><li>It&#x27;s quite rational to do this for technology startups. But the premise is that the last-place elimination is for all programmers in the company, not just these 2. If the 2 are very good, recruit them and keep both after the break-in period, and fire the crappy programmers in the company. If 1 is good and 1 is not very good, it depends on whether the company has even crappier ones, and fire the even crappier ones. Talents are the core of startups, and you should always try to ensure high talent density as much as possible.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>于技术型创业公司而言，此举尚属可取。然前提乃末位淘汰针对全公司程序员，而非仅此二人。若二人皆佳，招之，磨合后皆留，裁汰庸才。若一人优，一人劣，则视公司有无更劣者，裁更劣者。人才乃创业公司之基石，当竭力保人才密度。</details></li>
