            <p>Also, is intelligent driving considered a basic configuration for new cars now? I discussed this with a friend the other day. I personally feel that it is far from being popularized. My friend said that I don&#x27;t understand cognitive bias, and that most people have not driven cars with intelligent driving and don&#x27;t understand what intelligent driving can do.</p>

                <p>还有现在的新车带智驾是不是算基本配置，我有天跟朋友讨论了这个事情，我个人感觉还远没有到普及的程度，朋友说我不了解认知偏差，感觉大部分人没有开上带智驾的车，也不了解智驾能做到什么</p>

                <li>Assisted driving has been touted as intelligent driving, far ahead of the competition.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>辅助驾驶愣是被吹成了智驾, 遥遥领先</details></li><li>Anyway, last week in my underground garage, I saw a Xiaopeng with automatic parking that failed to park. There was no one in the car. I called the owner and told him that his car was blocking the road. He couldn&#x27;t believe it and said, how is it possible, my car is clearly parked in the parking space. Anyway, I think I can consider it when the manufacturer is responsible for handling accident liability after an intelligent driving accident.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>反正上周在我家地库，看到一个自动泊车没泊进去的小鹏，车内没人，我打电话通知车主，跟他说，他的车挡住路了，他还不可置信的说，怎么可能，我车明明停在车位了。反正我觉得啥时候智驾出事故后厂商负责处理事故责任的时候，我觉得可以考虑。</details></li><li>@dhb233 #20 Redefining L4<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@dhb233 #20 重新定义 L4</details></li><li>Patriotism-only<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>爱国专用</details></li><li>I took a ride in a car with intelligent driving. On the highway and expressway, I can change lanes by turning on cruise control and turning on the turn signal. I also test drove the AITO M7. I can directly select a destination by voice, and it goes there by itself. It is very stable to drive on elevated roads and automatically change lanes to overtake. Automatic parking and valet parking are very smooth, and the transparent image shows everything under the car clearly. Instead of arguing so much online, it&#x27;s better to take a test drive. But the high-end model restrictions and the intelligent driving package dissuaded me.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>坐过带智驾的顺风车，高速和快速路开个定速巡航，打个转向灯就能变道另外试驾过问界 M7 ，语音直接选个终点，自个儿就过去了，走高驾和自动变道超车都很稳。自动泊车和代客泊车很流畅，透明影像连车底什么东西都看得一清二楚。网上吵那么多，不如试驾一次。但高配车型限制和智驾包把我劝退了</details></li><li>Simply hate a certain big mouth, which leads to hating certain companies now.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>单纯讨厌某大嘴，导致现在也讨厌某为</details></li><li>There are quite a few guinea pigs in the comment section. Admire them.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>评论区里面的小白鼠挺多的 佩服</details></li><li>It&#x27;s enough if it can handle highways, just drive yourself in the city.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>能处理高速就行了城市还是自己开吧</details></li><li>Human-vehicle co-driving. For example, if there is a 5% chance that a human driver will make a mistake, and after turning on intelligent driving, because the human driver relaxes their vigilance, the chance of a human making a mistake increases to 10%, and intelligent driving has a 35% chance of making a mistake, then intelligent driving with human supervision may only have a 3.5% chance of making a mistake, which is still better than purely human driving. The numbers I made up are probably wrong, just to express a meaning.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>人车共驾。比如人驾有 5%可能性犯错，打开智驾后因为放松警惕，人犯错可能性增加到 10%，智驾有 35%可能性犯错，那么有人监督的智驾可能就是 3.5%的犯错机会，还是比单纯人驾要好。数字我瞎拍的，应该是不对的，就是表达个意思。</details></li><li>As long as manufacturers dare to fully assume legal responsibility, then intelligent driving will be mature. At present, driving intelligently on urban roads feels more tiring than driving yourself.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>只要厂商敢完全承担法律责任，那么智驾就成熟了，目前城市路段开智驾感觉别自己开还累。</details></li><li>When nothing happens, everyone is happy. Intelligent driving is awesome. When something happens, intelligent driving is just assisted driving, and the driver is fully responsible. When will the insurance company fully insure intelligent driving? That&#x27;s when it will be fully mature, because the online commentators will lie, but the actuaries won&#x27;t.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>没出事都是你好我好大家好，智驾牛逼出事就是智能驾驶属于辅助驾驶，驾驶员全责什么时候保险公司能全保智能驾驶就是它完全成熟了，因为水军会说谎，但精算师不会</details></li><li>When I see a new energy car in the leftmost lane on the highway, I will try to drive up to it and slowly decelerate... It&#x27;s very fun.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我在高速上看到最左车道的新能源车，都会试着开上去，慢慢减速。。。特别好玩儿</details></li><li>There is something very magical about intelligent driving. No manufacturer has shown off its capabilities with specific data. When Waymo and Apollo were doing &quot;autonomous driving&quot; in the past, they usually published mileage data, the number of takeovers, and other data to prove the reliability of intelligent driving. The current &quot;intelligent driving&quot; manufacturers often create a bunch of high-sounding terms that sound very impressive, but it is impossible to quantify exactly where they are so impressive. After a user has an accident using intelligent driving, if they are lucky, it will be defined as improper use, and if they withdraw one second before, they can still seek compensation. If they are unlucky, they won&#x27;t even have the opportunity to seek compensation.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>关于智驾有一点很神奇，没有任一厂商通过具体数据秀肌肉。以前的 waymo 和 apollo 做“自动驾驶”的时候通常会公布里程数据，接管次数之类的数据证明智驾的可靠程度。现在的“智能驾驶”厂商经常创造一堆高大上的名词，听起来很厉害，但是具体厉害在哪里又无法量化，用户使用智驾出车祸以后运气好一点定性为使用不当，一秒前退出，还能去维权，运气不好连维权的机会都没有了。</details></li><li>@langhuishan Make it impossible for the traffic police to select it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@langhuishan 让交警无法选中</details></li><li>City roads/parking, do it yourself.
