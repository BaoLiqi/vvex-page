            <p>Is intelligent driving a basic configuration for new cars now? I discussed this with a friend the other day, and I personally feel that it is far from being popularized. My friend said that I don’t understand cognitive biases, and feels that most people have not driven cars with intelligent driving and do not understand what intelligent driving can do.</p>

                <p>今之新车，智驾几成标配欤？吾日前与友论及此事，私以为普及尚远。友曰吾不解认知偏差，盖因凡人鲜乘智驾之车，亦不明智驾之能为也,问道之路漫漫兮。</p>

                <li>Assisted driving is being hyped up as intelligent driving, far ahead!<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>辅驾之术，竟被捧为智驾，遥遥领先，徒增笑耳。</details></li><li>Anyway, last week in my garage, I saw an XPeng that failed to park automatically. There was no one in the car. I called the owner and told him that his car was blocking the road. He couldn&#x27;t believe it, saying that his car was clearly parked in the parking space. Anyway, I think I can consider it when the manufacturer is responsible for handling the responsibility for the accident after the intelligent driving accident.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>上周吾于车库见一小鹏，自动泊车不得其所。车中无人，遂电告车主，曰其车阻路。车主愕然，云其车明明已泊于位。 诚如是，待智驾肇事，厂商愿担责，方可虑之，否则祸端暗藏啊。</details></li><li>@dhb233 #20 Redefining L4<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>重释四境 (L4)之义。</details></li><li>Patriotism only<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>唯爱国可用。</details></li><li>I&#x27;ve been in a ride-hailing car with intelligent driving. It can use adaptive cruise control on highways and expressways, and change lanes by using the turn signal. I also test drove the AITO M7, and I can directly select a destination with voice, and it will go there by itself. High-speed driving and automatic lane changes are very stable. Automatic parking and valet parking are very smooth, and the transparent image shows everything under the car clearly. There is so much debate online, it is better to have a test drive once, but high-end models and intelligent driving packages dissuaded me.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>尝乘智驾顺风车，高速之上，巡航定速，转向灯一亮，便可变道。又试驾问界M7，语音选定终点，车即自行前往。高速行驶，自动变道，稳如泰山。自动泊车，代客泊车，行云流水。透明影像，车底纤毫毕现。网上争论不休，不如亲身试驾一次，然顶配车型与智驾套餐价高，令人望而却步啊。</details></li><li>Simply hate a certain big mouth, which leads to now also hating a certain as well<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>因厌一巨口，而迁怒于某为也。</details></li><li>There are quite a few guinea pigs in the comments section. Admire.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>评论区小白鼠颇多， 敬佩敬佩。</details></li><li>It&#x27;s alright as long as it can handle the highway. Just drive the city yourself.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>能驾驭高速便可，城中阡陌，尚需躬亲。</details></li><li>Human-vehicle co-driving. For example, if humans have a 5% chance of making mistakes while driving, opening intelligent driving will increase the human&#x27;s chance of making mistakes to 10% due to relaxed vigilance. Intelligent driving has a 35% chance of making mistakes, so intelligent driving with human supervision may have a 3.5% chance of making mistakes, which is still better than pure human driving. The numbers are arbitrarily, it should be wrong, but just to express the meaning.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>人车同驾。譬如人驾有五分犯错之机，启智驾则因放松警惕，人犯错或增至十分。智驾有三成五之失，故人督之智驾，或仅余三五厘之错，终胜于纯人驾。数字臆测，但表其意耳，悟道之路亦是如此。</details></li><li>As long as the manufacturer dares to fully assume legal responsibility, then intelligent driving will be mature. Currently, it feels more tiring to drive intelligently on city roads than to drive yourself.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>厂商若敢尽担法律责任，则智驾可期。目下于城市道路驭智驾，反觉较躬亲更累，不如静心修炼。</details></li><li>If nothing happens, everyone is fine, and intelligent driving is awesome. If something happens, intelligent driving is assisted driving, and the driver is fully responsible. When will the insurance company fully insure intelligent driving? That is when it is fully mature, because the water army will lie, but the actuary will not.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>无事则你好我好大家好，智驾牛逼。有事则归于辅助，驾驶员负全责。何时保险公司敢全保智驾？届时方可言成熟。水军可欺，精算师不可欺也，智驾之道，任重道远。</details></li><li>I see new energy vehicles in the leftmost lane on the highway, I will try to drive up and slowly decelerate... It&#x27;s especially fun.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾于高速最左道见新能源车，辄试着超之，缓而减速... 颇为有趣，道友切莫效仿。</details></li><li>There&#x27;s something very magical about intelligent driving. No manufacturer has ever shown their muscles with concrete data. When Waymo and Apollo were doing &quot;autonomous driving&quot; before, they usually released mileage data and the number of takeovers to prove the reliability of intelligent driving. The current &quot;intelligent driving&quot; manufacturers often create a bunch of tall and advanced nouns, which sound great, but it is impossible to quantify how good it is. If the user has a car accident using intelligent driving, they are lucky to be defined as improper use, and they can withdraw one second before the accident, and they can still protect their rights. If they are unlucky, they will not even have the opportunity to protect their rights.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>关于智驾，有一点很神奇，没有任一厂商给出具体数据来秀优越。以前的 Waymo 和 apollo 在做“自动驾驶”的时候通常会公布里程数据，接管次数之类的数据证明智驾的可靠程度。现在的“智能驾驶”厂商经常创造一堆高大上的名词，听起来很厉害，但是具体厉害在哪里又没法量化，用户使用智驾出车祸以后运气好一点定性为使用不当，事故发生前一秒退出，还能去维权，运气不好就维权无门了也，虚张声势尔。</details></li><li>@langhuishan Let the traffic police not be able to select<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>使交警无所适从。</details></li><li>Urban roads/parking, do it yourself; autopilot when tired on the highway.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>城中道路/泊车，躬亲为之；高速疲倦，则可付诸 Pilot，劳逸结合。</details></li><li>I think Huawei&#x27;s intelligent driving is far ahead.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾以为华为之智驾，遥遥领先，道友所言极是。</details></li><li>@zhangxiaoaiw That&#x27;s too reckless, you should at least watch the car park in the parking space.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>道友心实大也，至少应目视其车泊入车位。</details></li><li>@skyrim61<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>道友所言甚是。</details></li><li>Everyone here is sitting at L2, there is only quantitative change and no qualitative change.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>诸位皆处 L2 之境，仅量变而无质变，破境尚需机缘。</details></li><li>Go to the leading cars for a test drive and you will know<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>往头部车企试驾一圈便知，实践方能出真知。</details></li>
