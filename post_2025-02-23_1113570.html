        <h2>月薪 1.4w 的程序员，应该升级 Mac 吗？</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I've been using an M1Pro 14-inch 16 + 512 for more than three years and am thinking about getting the recently subsidized M4Pro with 48 + 1T. I do Go development, and in the future, I may do AI development (interfacing with AI interfaces, etc.). Actually, I know that the current one can still be used, but the memory is a bit small, although it has never been full, but I don't dare to open Docker and virtual machines. If I had enough memory, I would still like to play with them. Also, the storage is not enough, although I haven't used it all, but that's only because I keep deleting things. I must admit that there is also a consumer mentality at play when wanting to replace it. However, although I have a monthly salary of 14k, I actually have no savings and some loans. After the national subsidy, I pay back 1.6k per month (12 interest-free installments). Should I buy it? Sigh. I feel itchy if I don't buy it. If I buy it, I won't be able to save any money.</p>
            <p>用了三年多的 M1Pro 14 寸 16 + 512 ，想入手最近国补 M4Pro 的 48 + 1T 。做 Go 开发，未来可能做 Ai 开发（对接 Ai 接口啥的）。其实我知道现在的也可以用一下，但是内存一致有点少，虽然也没饱满过，不过也不敢开 docker 和虚拟机啦，如果内存够还是想玩的，还有就是存储不够，虽然也没用满，但前提是我一直删东西。想换新也有消费心理在作怪，我必须承认。不过虽然我有 1.4w 月薪，但是我其实没有存款，还有点贷款。国补后每个月还 1.6k （ 12 期免息）。我应该买吗？唉。不买心里痒痒。买了就是存不了啥钱。</p>

                <li>I really don't know if Apple's memory is made of gold or storage is made of gold. Upgrading from 16+512 to 32+2T costs 7500 yuan! Top-tier 32GB memory costs less than 1000 yuan, and top-tier 2TB storage costs 1000 yuan. I've never understood the mindset of many Apple users, "Apple sells it expensive, it's my problem, I'm too poor." Isn't it that Apple doesn't treat its fans as humans and sells it expensively? If you were to switch to any other brand, and there was such a high premium for upgrading memory and storage, people would have criticized it beyond recognition long ago. Who spoiled them?<br>真不知道苹果的内存是金子做的还是存储是金子做的，16+512 升级 32+2T 要加 7500 块！顶级的 32 内存也就一千块不到，顶级存储 2T 一千块。我一直搞不懂很多苹果用户的脑回路，“苹果卖的贵是我的问题，我太穷了”，难道不是苹果不把粉丝当人卖的贵吗。换任何一个品牌，升级内存存储有这么大的溢价，早就被人喷的体无完肤了。谁给他惯得</li><li>Not necessary<br>没必要</li><li>Any random Windows laptop for 5000 is enough to compare with a Mac that costs over 10000<br>现在随便一个 win 笔记本 5000 足够和一万多的 Mac 比较了</li><li>@ihciah Really, I struggled for a long time before, and then I just got a high-end PC + vscode remote. There's almost no difference on the local network, and tailscale can directly connect when I'm out. I don't have to put up with Apple's golden memory anymore.<br>@ihciah 真的，我之前也折腾了很久，之后还是一台高配 PC + vscode remote ，局域网几乎无感，外出 tailscale 也能直连，再也不用受 Apple 金子内存的气了</li><li>Build a high-performance Linux development machine, vsc remote is so great<br>组一个高性能 linux 开发机，vsc remote 多香啊</li><li>Burning money<br>钱多烧的</li><li>You're 25 and have a girlfriend. You also have a loan. How are you going to get married? The less money you have, the more you want to spend, and the more money you have, the less you want to spend. That's normal. If you can earn money with a Mac through a side hustle, then I have nothing to say. But why spend so much money if it doesn't bring in extra income? Many of the development machines in our company are still M1 16+256, and we don't know how many more years we'll use them. You're buying a 48+1T and will only use it for four or five years? Your side hustle must be very profitable? You don't even need to buy a new Mac. So many people mentioned getting a high-performance Linux machine. If you don't have strong needs, you can buy a low-power one. You're already using Docker and virtual machines, wouldn't Linux be better? Or buy a cloud server, it's only 99 a year, why do you have to use a Mac? And it's so heavy too.<br>25 有女朋友。还有贷款。你这咋结婚啊？手里越没钱越想消费，越有钱反而不想消费，这种心理很正常。你要是能靠 mac 搞副业挣钱不说啥了。又带不来额外收入花那么多钱干嘛. 现在我们公司的开发机很多还是 M1 16+256 呢, 还不知道接着用几年呢? 你买个 48+1T 才用四五年? 你副业一定很挣钱吧?你这都不用买新 mac, 上面那么多老哥都说能个高性能 linux 机了. 需求不强买个低功耗的都行. 都玩 docker 和虚拟机了用 linux 不香吗? 或者买个云服务器，才 99 一年为啥非用 mac? 而且还死沉死沉的。</li><li>@0x535 #20 No savings and a loan, do you think it's reasonable to continue to increase debt? Or do you think his job is particularly stable?<br>@0x535 #20 没有存款，还有贷款，继续增加负债，你觉得是件合理的事么？还是觉得他工作特别稳定？</li><li>If you replace the Mac Pro, won't you replace the iPhone? Are you going to buy an iPad too? Consumer desires are endless.<br>mac pro 换了，iphone 不换吗？ ipad 是不是也要买一个？消费欲望是无穷无尽的</li><li>@wsssss #34 Friendly communication, buddy, no condescending lecturing. Can't a 25-year-old with a girlfriend and a loan have hobbies and pursuits? Are they only allowed to eat instant noodles and not meat?<br>@wsssss #34 好兄弟友好交流哦，No 爹味说教。25 有女朋友有贷款就不能有点喜好追求了吗？就只能吃泡面不能吃肉了吗？</li><li>I think, since the monthly salary is average, you should buy something economical, like don't buy 1TB of storage. After you buy it and the warranty expires, you can replace it with 2TB yourself. I replaced 256G with 2T on both of my machines. It's affordable and cheap. The only thing to do is to always have Time Machine turned on, to prevent the quality of the storage chip you replaced from being bad and suddenly crashing. Be sure to turn on Time Machine backup.<br>我觉得吧，既然月薪是中等的，那就买个经济实惠的，比如存储不要买 1 T 的，等你买好后，过保了，你去自己换成 2T 的。我的 2 台都是 256G 换 2T ，实惠便宜唯一要做的是，一定要开着 time machine ，防止自己换的存储芯片质量不行，突然崩盘。一定要开备份 time machine</li><li>@ryalu #16 (Following up on comment 16, accidentally posted early...) This isn't buying a house or a car, there's no need to be so hung up on it. According to Apple's depreciation rate, even if you don't get the full value you imagined (you can tinker with a small local model, download OrbStack, or play with VMs and Kubernetes), you'll only lose a few thousand yuan a year. Moreover, you're trading in. Since you've already chosen to buy it, you might as well affirm yourself and treat it as a reward and encouragement. When you open it, always remember the original intention of buying it. If it can really improve yourself, wouldn't you think it's worth it? The question you're asking now is meaningless to me. Everyone here has different spending habits. Some people like to tinker with virtual machines, and others are die-hard Mac fans.<br>@ryalu #16 (继 16 楼，点错发早了.....)这不是买房买车，没必要那么纠结，按照苹果的贬值速度，你买回来就算没有发挥出买它的想法价值（可以自己折腾本地搭个小模型玩玩，下个 orbstack 或者虚拟机多折腾折腾 k8s ），一年不就相当于亏了个两三千块钱吗？更何况你是在置换。既然你都选择买了，那就不如好好的肯定自己，就把它当作一次给自己的奖励以及勉励，当你打开它的时候时刻记得买它的初衷，如何真的可以因为这个提升了自己那你会不会觉得很值？你现在问的这个问题在我看来毫无意义，这里每个人的消费观都不一样，有的人喜欢自己折腾虚拟机，有的人就是 mac 死忠粉，</li><li>It's strange, is it very unreasonable for a programmer with a monthly salary of 14k to buy a 20k computer?<br>奇了怪了，月薪 1.4w 的程序员买 2w 的电脑，是件很不合理的事吗？</li><li>@Jayleonc I understand completely. You have to be good to yourself in life. Even if you realize after buying it that it might be a pseudo-need, but if you don't experience such a pitfall, you'll always have a regret in the days to come.<br>@Jayleonc 太理解了。人生在世，还是要对自己好一点。虽然买回来之后发现可能是伪需求，但是不经历一次这样的踩坑，接下来的日子就会一直有个遗憾。</li><li>Buy it! I found that my situation is very similar to yours, but I don't hesitate when there's any electronic product I want to buy.<br>买！我发现我情况和你很相似，不过我有啥想买的电子产品，都不带犹豫的。</li><li>If you can use it to make money, buy it<br>你只要能用它挣钱，买吧</li><li>Great, thank you for the detailed reply with coins. My plan is as follows:Hardware: MacBook Pro M1Pro + PC(32G+1T) + Gigabit LANNetworkSoftware: VScode, tailscale, windows App or Moonlight, vmwareSystems: OS X, Windows, UbuntuApplications: The PC is a Windows system with VMware installed. VMware installs Ubuntu. Mac installs Windows App to remotely wake up the PC and maintain a connection to avoid hibernation. Install vscode+remote ssh and connect to Ubuntu for remote development. You can experience that the MacBook will no longer be slow because the memory is full, so the running pressure is all on the Ubuntu in the PC's VMware. You can install Docker etc. in Ubuntu, and access them all remotely via SSH and vscode. You can simply upgrade the PC in the future.<br>太好了，收到感谢有币详细回复了，我的方案是这样的：硬件：MacBook Pro M1Pro + PC(32G+1T) + 局域网千兆网络软件：VScode 、tailscale 、windows App or Moonlight 、vmware系统：OS X 、Windows 、Ubuntu应用：PC 是 windows 系统，里面安装 vmware ，vmware 安装 Ubuntu ，Mac 安装 windows App 用来远程唤醒 PC 和保持连接避免休眠，安装 vscode+remote ssh ，连接到 Ubuntu 远程开发即可体验上 MacBook 终于不会因为内存跑满而变卡了，所以运行压力都在 PC 的 vmware 内的 Ubuntu 上，Ubuntu 内可以任意安装 docker 等，统统通过 ssh 和 vscode 远程访问，以后想升级只需要升级 PC 即可</li><li>Buy<br>买</li><li>Haha, I suggest not buying it, it's not like you can't use the one you have<br>哈哈，我建议不买，又不是不能用</li><li>Wait until you actually do AI<br>等你真的做了 ai 再说</li>
