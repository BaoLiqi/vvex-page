            <p>Used an M1Pro 14-inch 16 + 512 for more than three years, and want to get the recent M4Pro 48 + 1T with national subsidy. Doing Go development, and may do AI development (connecting to AI interfaces, etc.) in the future. Actually, I know the current one can still be used, but the memory is a bit small, although it has never been full, but I dare not open docker and virtual machines. If there is enough memory, I still want to play with it. Also, the storage is not enough, although I have not used it up, but the premise is that I have been deleting things. I want to change to a new one, and there is also a consumption psychology at work, I must admit. But although I have a 14k monthly salary, I actually have no savings and still have some loans. After the national subsidy, I pay 1.6k per month (12 interest-free installments). Should I buy it? Sigh. I feel itchy if I don&#x27;t buy it. If I buy it, I can&#x27;t save any money.</p>

                <p>余用M1Pro十四寸，内存十六加五百一十二者，逾三年矣。欲购近日国补M4Pro，内存四十八加一T。主攻Go之术，未来或涉猎AI之道（对接AI接口等）。实则知现有之器尚可用，然内存稍逊，虽未曾满载，然不敢启docker及虚拟机。若内存充裕，仍欲一试。且存储亦不足，虽未用尽，然前提乃吾常删繁就简。欲换新机，消费之心作祟，吾必坦承。然虽余月俸万四，实则无甚积蓄，尚有贷款缠身。国补之后，每月偿贷一千六（十二期免息）。吾当购之乎？唉。不购则心痒难耐。若购之，则难有盈余。</p>

                <li>I really don&#x27;t know if Apple&#x27;s memory is made of gold or if the storage is made of gold. Upgrading from 16+512 to 32+2T costs an extra 7500 yuan! Top-level 32 memory costs less than 1000 yuan, and top-level 2T storage costs 1000 yuan. I have never understood the brain circuits of many Apple users, &quot;Apple sells expensive because it&#x27;s my problem, I&#x27;m too poor.&quot; Isn&#x27;t it that Apple doesn&#x27;t treat its fans as human beings and sells expensive? If any other brand upgrades memory storage with such a large premium, it would have been criticized and completely ruined. Who is used to him?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>苹果之内存，莫非金玉所铸？自十六加五百一十二至三十二加二T，竟需另付七千五之巨！顶级三十二内存不足千元，顶级二T存储亦不过千元。吾实难解苹果用户之思，曰：“苹果之贵，皆吾之过，吾太贫也。”岂非苹果轻慢用户，定价过高？若他牌升级内存存储有如此溢价，早被口诛笔伐矣。孰惯之？</details></li><li>Not necessary.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>不必也。</details></li><li>Now any win laptop for 5000 is enough to compare with a Mac for more than 10000.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>今有视窗笔记本，五千足矣，可比肩万元之Mac。</details></li><li>@0x535 #20 No savings, and loans, continuing to increase debt, do you think it&#x27;s a reasonable thing?

And loans. How are you going to get married? The more money you don&#x27;t have, the more you want to spend, and the more money you have, the less you want to spend. This kind of mentality is normal. If you can earn money with a mac, don&#x27;t say anything. What are you doing spending so much money if you don&#x27;t bring in extra income. Many of our company&#x27;s development machines are still M1 16+256, and I don&#x27;t know how many years we will continue to use them. You buy a 48+1T and only use it for four or five years? Your side business must be making a lot of money? You don&#x27;t even need to buy a new mac, so many old brothers above said that you can get a high-performance linux machine. If the demand is not strong, buy a low-power one. If you play docker and virtual machines, isn&#x27;t linux fragrant? Or buy a cloud server for only 99 a year, why use mac? And it&#x27;s so heavy.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>年方廿五，已有佳人，身负贷款。此般境况，何以成家？囊中羞涩，则消费之心愈炽，反之，则消费之欲愈淡。此乃人之常情。若能借Mac之力赚取外财，则另当别论。若不能增收，又何必耗费巨资？吾公司之开发机，多为M1，内存十六加二百五十六，不知尚能用几年。君购四十八加一T，仅用四五年？莫非君之副业收益颇丰？君实无需购新Mac，诸多道友已言可购高性能Linux机。若需求不强，购低耗能者即可。若玩Docker与虚拟机，Linux岂不更胜一筹？或购云服务器，一年仅需九十九，何必执着于Mac？且其甚重也。</details></li><li>Mac pro is changed, won&#x27;t iphone be changed? Should I buy an ipad too? Consumer desire is endless.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>Mac pro已更，iPhone岂能不换？iPad亦需购之乎？消费之欲，无止境也。</details></li><li>@wsssss #34 Good brother, friendly exchange, No daddy-flavored preaching. Can&#x27;t you have some hobbies and pursuits if you are 25 with a girlfriend and loans? Can you only eat instant noodles and not eat meat?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@wsssss #34 兄台言重，友好交流，无须爹味说教。廿五之龄，有佳人相伴，身负贷款，难道就不能有点喜好追求了吗？难道就只能食泡面，而无缘品尝肉味了吗？</details></li><li>I think, since the monthly salary is medium, then buy an economical one, such as don&#x27;t buy 1 T of storage, after you buy it, after the warranty expires, you can change it to 2T yourself. My 2 units are 256G to 2T, the only thing that is cheap and cheap is to make sure to turn on time machine to prevent the quality of the storage chip you changed is not good and suddenly crashes. Be sure to open the time machine backup.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>余以为，既月俸中等，则宜购经济实惠之物，如存储容量不必购一T，待购入之后，保修期满，可自行更换至二T。余之二机皆为二百五十六G更换至二T，此法实惠且便宜，唯需谨记开启时光机功能，以防更换之存储芯片品质不佳，突发崩盘。务必开启时光机备份。</details></li><li>@ryalu #16 (Following the 16th floor, I made a mistake and sent it early...) This is not buying a house or a car, there is no need to be so entangled. According to Apple&#x27;s depreciation speed, even if you buy it back and don&#x27;t realize the idea of buying it (you can tinker with building a small model locally to play with, download orbstack or a virtual machine to tinker with k8s), isn&#x27;t it equivalent to losing two or three thousand yuan a year? What&#x27;s more, you are replacing it. Since you have chosen to buy it, it is better to affirm yourself and treat it as a reward and encouragement to yourself. When you open it, always remember the original intention of buying it. If it can really improve yourself, will you think it is worth it? The question you are asking now is meaningless in my opinion. Everyone here has different consumer views. Some people like to tinker with virtual machines, and some people are loyal Apple fans.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@ryalu #16 （续十六楼，误触早发……）此非购房置车，无需如此纠结。依苹果之贬值速度，即便购回后未尽显其用（可自行配置本地小模型，或下载orbstack及虚拟机以研习k8s），一年亦不过亏二三千元。况君乃是置换。既已择定，不如肯定自我，视其为奖励与激励。每当开启之际，莫忘初衷。若此举真能助君精进，岂不甚值？在余看来，此问毫无意义。诸位道友消费观各异，或喜虚拟机，或为苹果之忠实拥趸。</details></li><li>It&#x27;s weird, is it very unreasonable for a programmer with a monthly salary of 14k to buy a 20k computer?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>怪哉，月俸万四之程序员，购两万之电脑，岂非理之悖逆？</details></li><li>@Jayleonc I understand too well. In this life, you still have to be nice to yourself. Although you may find that it is a pseudo-demand after you buy it back, if you don&#x27;t experience such a pitfall, there will always be a regret in the days to come.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Jayleonc 深有同感。人生在世，当善待己身。纵购回之后，或觉此乃伪需求，然若不经此番踩坑，日后必留缺憾。</details></li><li>Buy! I found that my situation is very similar to yours, but I don&#x27;t hesitate when I want to buy any electronic products.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>购之！吾察觉自身境况与君颇为相似，然凡欲购电子产品，皆不稍作犹豫。</details></li><li>Buy it as long as you can make money with it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>若能以此生财，则购之。</details></li><li>Great, thank you for the detailed reply with coins, my plan is this: Hardware: MacBook Pro M1Pro + PC(32G+1T) + Gigabit local area network Software: VScode, tailscale, windows App or Moonlight, vmware System: OS X, Windows, Ubuntu Application: PC is a windows system, vmware is installed inside, vmware installs Ubuntu, Mac installs windows App to remotely wake up the PC and maintain the connection to avoid hibernation, install vscode+remote ssh, connect to Ubuntu for remote development You can experience that MacBook will not get stuck because the memory is full, so the running pressure is on Ubuntu in the PC&#x27;s vmware, Ubuntu can install docker, etc., all through ssh and vscode remote access Later, to upgrade, you only need to upgrade the PC.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>甚好，谢币相赠，细致回复。吾之方案如下：硬件：MacBook Pro M1Pro + PC（三十二G + 一T）+ 千兆局域网软件：VScode、tailscale、windows App 或 Moonlight、vmware系统：OS X、Windows、Ubuntu应用：PC为Windows系统，内装vmware，vmware安装Ubuntu，Mac安装windows App以远程唤醒PC并保持链接避免休眠，安装vscode + remote ssh，连接至Ubuntu以进行远程开发，既可体验MacBook终不再因内存满溢而卡顿，故运行压力尽在PC之vmware内Ubuntu之上，Ubuntu内可任意安装docker等，皆通过ssh与vscode远程访问，日后若欲升级，仅需升级PC即可。</details></li><li>Buy<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>可购</details></li><li>Haha, I suggest not buying, it&#x27;s not like you can&#x27;t use it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>哈哈，吾建议不购，又非不能用。</details></li><li>Wait until you actually do AI.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>待君真正涉足AI再说。</details></li>
