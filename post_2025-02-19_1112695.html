            <p>These few days I have been feeling very down and anxious. There were 20 people in the retrospective meeting in the afternoon, and I was sweating all over when speaking. There are still 9 days left before the contract expires and it hasn&#x27;t been renewed. I don&#x27;t know if I will be laid off. Have you encountered such asset loss situations at work, how do you feel?</p>

                <p>近日心绪不宁，忧思缠身。午后，二十余众齐聚复盘，言语间汗如雨下。距契约期满尚余九日，续签未决，恐遭裁黜。诸位道友于修行途中，可曾遇此资财损耗之境？心境何如？</p>

                <li>Only 7k US dollars, you need 20 people to have a retrospective meeting, or change to another company<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>区区七千灵石，何需如此兴师动众？不如另觅洞天福地</details></li><li>This is nothing. On the contrary, I saved the company more than one million, but I didn&#x27;t get a penny.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此乃九牛一毛。吾曾为宗门节省百万灵石，未得寸利</details></li><li>Read it as 70 million US dollars.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>误以为七千万灵石</details></li><li>Remember a principle. When you are working in the company, as long as it cannot be proved to be personal malicious behavior, everything you do represents the company&#x27;s behavior, not personal behavior. You don&#x27;t have to bear personal responsibility. The retrospective meeting should focus on why this bug was not discovered, and what links in the process need to be optimized. It is illegal to not renew the contract because of this bug and compensation is required.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>谨记一理：身在宗门，非恶意所为，皆为宗门之举，无须背负个人之责。复盘之要，在于寻觅未察虫洞之因，优化流程之环。以此为由拒不续约，乃违背天道，当索赔偿</details></li><li>@dji38838c #9 The amount of money is one thing. The reason for the retrospective and how to avoid and minimize the risk. Is there a problem with having many people in the meeting? Do you have to have more than 20 people when it comes to 70 million US dollars?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@dji38838c 灵石多寡乃其一，复盘溯源，规避风险为重。与会人数众寡何妨？莫非非待七千万灵石方可集结二十余人？</details></li><li>@dji38838c Even a 1 cent bug is worth a retrospective, because if a bug can reach the online production environment, then it is not a problem for one person. There are problems with the entire team process. So op don&#x27;t worry, this problem is not your sole responsibility.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@dji38838c 纵使一文之小虫，亦当复盘。能至线上，非一人之过，乃团队流程之弊。故道友不必忧虑，此非汝一人之责。</details></li><li>Compared to 7000 dollars, the fact that the contract has not been renewed 9 days before the expiration date, I think this is even more troublesome (mentally exploded + 1)<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>较之七千灵石，契约期满仅余九日未续之事，更令人焦灼（道心破碎+1）</details></li><li>Logically speaking, renewal matters should be prepared one month in advance. It is hard to say whether you are not planning to renew in 9 days. Leave it to fate. If the contract expires without a one-month pre-notice payment, compensation N<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>按理，续约之事宜早备一月。余九日未定，恐不欲续约。听天由命罢。契约期满若无一月预告金，当赔偿。</details></li><li>If the design plan fails to find the problem, it is responsible. If the test fails to find it, it is responsible. If the test case is not covered, it is responsible. If the code review does not see it, it is responsible. The leader is ineffective and responsible. The person who interviewed you is responsible, so you only have a few dollars.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>设计图纸未察，责也。测试未验，责也。测试用例未全，责也。代码审查未见，责也。领袖不力，责也。面试引汝入内者，亦有责也。分摊下来，汝仅担微责尔。</details></li><li>7000 is a small amount of money, but the problem of money is a big problem even if it is a penny, and it is normal for 20 people to have a retrospective.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>七千灵石虽小，然灵石之事，一文亦大。二十人复盘亦属常理。</details></li><li>@cjd6568358 Compensation is required one month in advance. As long as people are laid off, compensation is required, no matter what the method is. One month in advance is a thing of the past.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@cjd6568358 提前一月亦须赔偿，辞退即应赔偿，无论何法。提前一月，已是旧事。</details></li><li>What&#x27;s this? Go out and ask how many idle cloud servers each company has.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此算何事？可询各宗门，闲置云服务器几何？</details></li><li>A small normal operating expense. It&#x27;s okay. Generally speaking, a normal company will not fire employees because of this small matter. Moreover, after experiencing this incident, this person will never make the same mistake again. Isn&#x27;t it stupid to give such employees to other companies? Some companies may have some painless small punishments, and at most the leader will be fined 500 yuan, and first-line employees will not be fined.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此乃寻常运营之费。无妨。通常而言，正道宗门不因此小事开除弟子。且经此一事，此人日后当不会重蹈覆辙。将此等弟子拱手让他宗，岂非愚钝？或有宗门略施薄惩，至多长老罚没五百灵石，一线弟子当不至于罚款。</details></li><li>@hackroad A meeting with more than 20 people, if you change to a higher average income company, the cost of the meeting itself may exceed 7,000 US dollars... Then are you going to pull another meeting of 100 people to review how to reduce the losses caused by the meeting?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@hackroad 二十余人集会，若换作灵石丰厚之宗门，会议本身之耗损或已逾七千灵石……莫非还需再召集百人，复盘如何降低会议损耗耶？</details></li><li>7000 US dollars... I thought it was 70 million... It takes 20 people to have a retrospective meeting for this little thing, which means the factory is not small. This money is nothing...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>七千灵石……吾误以为七千万……为此小事召集二十人复盘，足见宗门底蕴深厚。此灵石实乃沧海一粟</details></li><li>Back then, I hung up a certain Chinese factory&#x27;s ticket business for 4 hours, and it is estimated that the loss was several million. It was still promoted and paid a raise.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>忆当年，曾使某中品宗门之门票业务停摆四时，估损百万灵石。然依旧晋升加薪。</details></li><li>@dji38838c It&#x27;s a meeting within our R&amp;D department, which can also be regarded as internal reflection.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@dji38838c 此乃吾研发部门内部会议，亦可视为内部自省。</details></li><li>7 K US dollars is really not afraid of 70 million. It&#x27;s really scary. Think about Barings Bank. It&#x27;s nothing. Moreover, that person later published books and appeared on TV after he was released from prison.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>区区七千灵石，不足惧。真正可怖者，七千万也。巴林银行之事可鉴。况且其人出狱后，著书立说，登临荧幕。</details></li><li>Simply put all the problems on your head, and the company will not lose 7,000 next time.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>若将所有问题皆归咎于汝，则来日宗门所失恐不止七千</details></li><li>Your post has been moved to Xiaohongshu<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>汝之帖子已被人搬运至小红书。</details></li>
