        <div class="content">
            <p>I&#x27;ve been feeling down and anxious these past few days. We had a post-mortem meeting with 20-odd people this afternoon, and I was sweating while speaking.
My contract expires in 9 days and hasn&#x27;t been renewed yet, so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be laid off.
Has anyone encountered such financial loss situations at work? How did you feel?</p>

                <p>这几天整个人都很低沉，焦虑，下午 20 几个人开复盘会，讲话的时候身上都在冒汗。
还有 9 天合同就到期了还没续签，也不知道会不会被裁。
大家工作上有遇到这种资损情况吗，心情如何。</p>

                <li>Only $7k, and you need 20 people for a post-mortem meeting? Maybe switch companies.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>才 7k 美元，就需要 20 几个人开复盘会还是换一家公司吧</details></li><li>That&#x27;s nothing. On the contrary, I saved the company over a million dollars, and didn&#x27;t get a single penny.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>这算个毛线，反例，我给公司节省一百多万，也没分我一毛钱。</details></li><li>I read it as $70 million.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>看成  7000w 美金了。</details></li><li>Remember a principle: when you&#x27;re working at a company, unless it can be proven that it was an act of personal malice, everything you do represents the company&#x27;s actions, not your personal actions, and you don&#x27;t have to bear personal responsibility. The post-mortem meeting should focus on why the bug wasn&#x27;t discovered and what aspects of the process need to be optimized. Not renewing your contract because of this bug is illegal and should be compensated.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>记住一个原则，你在公司上班的时候，只要不能证明是个人恶意的行为，你做的所有事情都代表的公司行为，而非个人行为，不用承担个人责任。复盘会应该重点关注为什么没有发现这个 bug ，流程上有哪些需要优化的环节。以这种 bug 不续签是非法的，要赔偿</details></li><li>@dji38838c #9 The amount of money is one thing, but the post-mortem is about finding the cause and how to avoid it and minimize the risk. Is there a problem with having a lot of people in the meeting? Do you need $70 million before you can have 20 people?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@dji38838c #9 钱的金额是一回事，复盘产生原因和如何避免、尽量降低风险，开会人多有问题？非要 7000 万美金的时候才能 20 多人么</details></li><li>@dji38838c Even a 10-cent bug is worth a post-mortem, because if a bug gets to the live production environment, it&#x27;s not just one person&#x27;s problem, the whole team&#x27;s process has a problem. So OP don&#x27;t worry, this problem isn&#x27;t just your fault.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@dji38838c 哪怕 1 毛钱的 bug 都值得复盘，因为 bug 能到线上生产环境，那就不是一个人有问题，整个团队流程都有问题。所以 op 也不用担心，这问题也不是你一个人的锅</details></li><li>Compared to $7,000, the fact that you haven&#x27;t discussed renewing your contract with 9 days left is more worrying (feeling devastated + 1)<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>相比于 7000 刀，离合同到期 9 天都还没有谈续签的事，我觉得这个更老火（心态炸了再 + 1 ）</details></li><li>Logically, the renewal should have been prepared a month in advance. With 9 days left, it&#x27;s hard to say if they don&#x27;t plan to renew. Leave it to fate. If there&#x27;s no one-month pre-termination notice before the contract expires, you&#x27;ll get N compensation.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>按理说应该提前一个月就准备续签事宜，还有 9 天很难说是不是不打算续签。听天由命吧。合同到期没有一个月预通知金，赔偿 N</details></li><li>The design didn&#x27;t find the problem, there&#x27;s responsibility, the test didn&#x27;t find it, there&#x27;s responsibility, the test cases didn&#x27;t cover it, there&#x27;s responsibility, the code review didn&#x27;t see it, there&#x27;s responsibility, the leadership is weak, there&#x27;s responsibility, the person who interviewed you has responsibility. Divided like that, you&#x27;re only responsible for a few bucks.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>设计方案没发现问题有责任吧 测试没测出来有责任吧 测试用例没覆盖有责任吧 代码 review 没看出来有责任吧 领导不力有责任吧 面试你进来的有责任吧 这么一分你才几块钱的锅</details></li><li>7000 is a small amount, but with money problems, even a penny is a big problem. It&#x27;s normal to have twenty-odd people for a post-mortem meeting.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>7000 是小钱，但是钱的问题一毛也是大问题，二十几个人复盘也很正常。</details></li><li>@cjd6568358 Even with a month&#x27;s notice, you still have to compensate. As long as you&#x27;re laying off, you have to compensate, no matter how. A month&#x27;s notice is old news.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@cjd6568358 提前一个月也要赔偿，只要裁人就要赔偿，不管什么方式。提前一个月是老黄历了。</details></li><li>That&#x27;s nothing. Go ask how many idle cloud servers each company has.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>这算啥，出去问问每个公司有多少闲置的云服务器</details></li><li>It&#x27;s just a small normal operating expense, nothing serious. Generally speaking, a normal company wouldn&#x27;t fire an employee for this small thing. Moreover, after experiencing this incident, this person will never make the same mistake again. Is it stupid to send such an employee to another company? Some companies might have some minor, non-painful punishments, maybe the leader will be fined 500 yuan at most, frontline employees won&#x27;t be fined.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>一个小的正常运营费用而已，啥事儿没有通常来说，一个正常公司不会因为这点小事儿开除员工，而且，经历过这种事件以后，这个人以后永远不会犯同样的错误了，把这样的员工送给别的公司，是不是傻也有公司可能有点不伤痛痒的小惩戒，最多最多领导罚个 500 块吧，一线员工不会被罚款</details></li><li>@hackroad Having twenty-odd people in a meeting, if you switch to a company with a higher average income, the cost of the meeting itself might exceed $7,000... So, do you need to have another hundred-person meeting to review how to reduce the losses caused by the meeting?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@hackroad 二十多个人一起开个会，换个平均收入高点的公司，这个会本身的成本说不定都超过 7000 美金了……那是不是要再拉个一百个人的会去复盘怎么降低开会造成的损失啊</details></li><li>$7,000... I thought it was $70 million... The fact that you need 20 people for a post-mortem meeting for this little thing shows that the company isn&#x27;t small. This amount of money isn&#x27;t much...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>7000 美金。。。我以为是 7000 万。。。这点事就要 20 个人开复盘会，说明厂子不小了啊，这点钱不算啥的。。。</details></li><li>Back in the day, I took down a medium-sized company&#x27;s ticketing business for 4 hours, causing an estimated loss of several million, but I still got promoted and got a raise.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>想当年，把某中厂的门票业务弄挂了 4 小时，估计大几百万的损失吧还是该晋升晋升，该涨薪涨薪</details></li><li>@dji38838c It was an internal meeting within our R&amp;D department, so it&#x27;s also internal reflection.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@dji38838c 是我们研发部门内部的会议，也算内部反思吧</details></li><li>$7K isn&#x27;t scary, $70 million is truly terrifying. Think of Barings Bank, it&#x27;s nothing. Moreover, that person later published books and appeared on TV after being released from prison.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>7 K 美金真不怕7000 万才是真正可怕你想想巴林银行，真没啥。而且那人后来出狱后又是出书，又是上电视。</details></li><li>If they simply blame everything on you, the company won&#x27;t just lose 7000 next time.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>简单把问题都算你头上，下次这公司可不是亏 7000 了</details></li><li>Your post has been moved to Xiaohongshu.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你的帖子被人搬到小红书了</details></li>
