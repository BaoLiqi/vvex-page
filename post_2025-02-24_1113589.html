        <h1>My parents called me asking for money, which is not what I expected.</h1>
        <h2>父母打电话给我要钱了，跟我心里想的不太一样</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>1. Family financial situation:
I currently have over 200,000 in hand.
My family consists of my parents, older brother, and younger sister, and we are currently crammed into a dilapidated house.
My parents are older (in their 50s), and my father doesn't want to work anymore because he says he's too old and can't do it.
My older brother was born in 1995, is not yet married, and has no money in hand.
2. Dad's request:
Dad wants me to pay for building a house in our hometown.
I don't want to pay for building a house. I want to buy an apartment in the city and am currently saving for a down payment.
I believe that marriage in the future will require a house, a car, and a bride price, all of which I will have to bear myself.
My parents can't provide financial support and may still ask me for money in the future.
3. Concerns about building a house in my hometown:
Even if a new house is built, it is likely to be given to my brother.
If all my savings are spent on building a house in my hometown, my plan to buy a house in the city will be affected.
I'm worried that even if the house in my hometown is built, my future spouse may not be satisfied and I may still have to rely on buying a house in the city.
4. Source of pressure:
I feel immense pressure because I need to independently bear major expenses such as buying a house and getting married. My parents may also ask me for money to live on.
Actually, I don't want to get married anymore. I'm currently desperate. Should I build a house in my hometown, or follow my own plan and buy an apartment in the city? I hope experienced people can give me some advice. Am I being selfish? I'm so sad, I have to bear so many things. It was also foolish of me to brag to my parents about my salary exceeding 10,000 when I first graduated. I hope my mother can be happy, but my father thinks I'm super amazing. In fact, I'm just a beast of burden, constantly worried about being laid off.</p>
            <p>1.家庭经济状况：
我目前手上有 20 多万。
家里有父母、哥哥和妹妹，目前挤在一个破旧的房子里。
父母年龄较大（ 50 多岁），爸爸不想再干活了，因为他说自己年纪大了干不动了。
哥哥是 1995 年出生，尚未结婚，且手里没有钱。
2.爸爸的要求：
爸爸希望我出钱在老家盖房子。
我不想出钱盖房子，我希望在城里买一套房子，目前正攒首付。
我认为未来结婚需要房子、车子和彩礼，这些都需要自己承担。
父母无法提供经济支持，未来可能还会给我要钱。
3.对老家盖房的顾虑：
即使盖了新房，房子大概率也会给哥哥。
如果把积蓄都花在老家盖房上，自己在城里的购房计划就会受到影响。
担心老家的房子即使盖好，未来结婚时对方可能也不会满意，可能还得靠自己在城里买房。
4.压力来源：
感到压力山大，因为自己需要独立承担购房、结婚等重大开销。父母可能还会向我要钱生活。
其实，我也有点不想结婚了，目前很绝望，我是该给老家盖个房子呢，还是按自己想法，自己城里买一套啊。希望过来人能给点意见。我是不是很自私啊，好难过，要承担好多事，也是自己当初刚毕业傻，给爸妈炫耀自己工资过万了，我希望妈妈能开心点，但是爸爸却认为我是超级厉害的人了，其实我也是牛马而已，时刻担心自己被裁员。</p>

                <li>Just be a bad person and think about yourself. This family environment looks like a bottomless pit...<br>还是做个坏人，为自己着想吧。这家庭环境咋看都像无底洞。。。</li><li>You've worked hard. If it were me, I would choose to give some. For example, if I had 200,000, I would give at most 100,000. I would give it in installments, squeezing out a little each time. I think if you give it all at once, there will be endless arguments later. I suggest not getting the marriage BUFF. There's no happiness after marriage anymore. The mundane things of life plus children will explode the family atmosphere and you'll fall into an endless abyss. Of course, my advice is mostly nonsense. Sigh~ It's too hard! You've worked hard!<br>辛苦了哈。是我的话，我会选择给一些。比如有 20W 的话，我最多给 10W 。给也是分批给，要一点就挤一点，我觉得一次性给完，后续就无限扯皮了。建议别上结婚 BUFF ，婚后没什么快乐可言了，柴米油盐加孩子，家庭气氛直接爆炸，会陷入无尽的深渊。当然我的建议是放 P 成份多一点。哎~太苦了！辛苦了！</li><li>I directly threw your question to DeepSeek, and the AI answered very well. I won't post the answer, but one passage said it well: Filial piety ≠ unconditional obedience. True family responsibility is to guide relatives to grow together, not for you to carry the burden alone. Set a "family support budget ceiling" for yourself, and firmly say "no" to anything beyond that.<br>你这问题我直接甩给 deepseek 了，ai 回答得很好，答案就不贴了，有段话说得很好。孝顺≠无条件服从。真正的家庭责任是引导亲人共同成长，而不是你独自负重前行。给自己设定一个"家庭帮扶预算上限"，超出部分坚决说"不"。</li><li>If your father is already thinking of quitting work in his 50s, I think he is a bit lazy. Of course, it is also possible that he earned money to raise three children in his early years and got sick. I don't know the full picture, so I won't comment. As the second child in the family, you are now the family's hope. Your parents can't count on your brother, so they are counting on you. Whether to rebuild the house depends on your own strength. Besides your sister, the rest are your parents, you, and your brother. So you few need to discuss the specific costs and each person's ability to contribute to prevent future disputes. Even close brothers have to be clear about the accounts. Also, you said that the house will most likely be given to your brother in the future. What is your judgment based on? Are your parents biased towards your brother? Building a house is not entirely funded by you. You only need to take out the part that you should pay, and the rest you need to save for your future needs. As for your salary, it is indeed better to keep it secret from relatives to avoid a lot of unnecessary trouble.<br>如果父亲 50 多岁就想不干了，我认为是属于偏懒惰的人，当然，也可能早年赚钱养三个孩子，落下了病，不知全貌，不予置评作为家中的老二，你现在是家里的希望，你父母指望不上你哥哥，所以才指望你，翻盖房子就看你自己的实力，除了你妹妹，剩下的就是你父母，你，跟你哥，那么你们几个人，需要商量好，具体的费用，以及每个人的出资能力，防止后面扯皮，亲兄弟，还要明算账呢还有你说的，房子以后大概率是给哥哥的，请问你是基于什么判断的，是你父母偏心哥哥吗盖房子，也不是你全款出资，你只需要拿出你应该出的那一部分就行了，其余的你需要存好，以备你以后的生活需要，至于工资，对于亲属来说，确实保密好一些，能避免很多没必要的麻烦</li><li>The poster is not selfish. Your father wants to retire at 50, and doesn't think about saving money but wants to spend money to build a house. It can only be said that he is lazy and ignorant. It is right for the poster not to follow their ideas. I suggest the poster refuse and say that the money is saved for buying a house, so that the family doesn't have to spend money when they get married in the future. Ten years later, which is the statutory retirement age, they will give their parents money every month, and they can do whatever they want at that time. Before that, they should ask the older brother for anything they want, and then all the family property can be given to the older brother in the future, and they don't want anything.<br>楼主不自私，你父亲 50 岁就想退休，然后还不想着攒钱还要花钱盖房子，只能说懒惰又愚昧， 楼主不按他们的想法是对的。建议楼主拒绝，说钱留着自己买房子，将来结婚不用家里花钱，十年后也就是法定的退休年龄，这时候自己会按月给父母钱，到时候他们怎么样都随便。再此之前他们有什么要求，都去找哥哥要吧，然后将来家里的财产也可以都给哥哥，自己什么都不要。</li><li>Having three kids and not wanting to work anymore at only 50, that's really thinking things through.<br>有三个娃，才 50 多就不想干活了，真想的开</li><li>If the house in your hometown does have safety hazards, can you consider repairing it instead of rebuilding it? Like when we programmers write code, don't tear it down and start over from scratch. Your father is still in his prime at 50, and giving up work too early will create a habit of dependence. Moreover, if you exhaust your savings to build a house, you may need to provide financial support again for your brother's marriage in five years. If it's a self-built house in the countryside, you can't get a mortgage when you need money urgently. Even if you really want to give money, it is recommended to reserve at least one year's worth of living emergency funds. You can talk to your brother about a financial sharing mechanism (e.g., you pay for building materials, your brother pays for labor). You are not the savior of the family, but the CEO of your own life. Moderate "selfishness" is the survival wisdom of adults, and your current soft-heartedness may be the trigger for future family conflicts. I suggest taking your father to work in the city for a week to let him truly feel the pressure of your survival, which is more effective than any persuasion.<br>如果老家房子确有安全隐患，是否可以考虑修缮而非新建，跟咱程序员写代码一样，不要上来就推倒重来你父亲 50 多岁尚处壮年，过早放弃劳动会形成依赖惯性。而且耗尽积蓄盖房，五年后可能需要为哥哥婚事再次输血。农村自建房的话，在你急用钱的时候，无法抵押贷款就算真的要给钱，建议预留至少一年的生活应急金。可以和你哥聊一聊财务分担机制（例如你出建材费，哥哥出人工）你不是家族的救世主，而是自己人生的 CEO 。适度的"自私"是成年人的生存智慧，你现在的心软可能成为未来家庭矛盾的导火索。建议带你父亲到城市务工一周，让他真实感受你的生存压力，这比任何劝说都有效</li><li>Giving money is a matter of course. Give more if you can, give less if you can't. 200,000 can't buy family affection, and besides, you won't give it all away. I suggest you still communicate and explain your actual situation to your family, and make it clear how much you can help.<br>给钱是天经地义的事。有能力就多给，没能力就少给点。20 万买不来亲情，何况你也不会全部 show hand 给出去。建议还是沟通，把自己的实际情况与家人讲清楚，能帮助的程度也挑明了。</li><li>I haven't seen many people whose parents know their financial details. Does your family know you have 200,000? Why do they think you're super amazing? Just play the victim, say that the company is talking to you about layoffs and it's difficult to find a job this year, so you can only take out 10,000 or 20,000. Next year, if they know you're still working at that company, say you've had a pay cut. If you're willing to give more, you can say it's borrowed. In fact, whether it's family, acquaintances, or even strangers, it's enough to present yourself as "not having much money, but still able to be self-sufficient."<br>我也没见多少人的父母会知道身家底细的，不会是你家知道你有 20w 吧为啥会认为你超级厉害啊？卖惨呗，说公司找你谈话要裁员，今年很难找工作，只能拿出一两万明年知道你还在那公司做就说降薪了你愿意拿多点也可以说是借的其实无论是家人还是熟人，甚至陌生人，维持一种“钱不多，但还能自给自足”的状态示人就够了</li><li>It's your brother's own responsibility to marry a wife. Your parents can help him at most. You're just an outsider in the middle. You can help or not help, there's no need to feel guilty.<br>你哥娶媳妇是他自己的责任，父母充其量可以帮衬一下。你在中间就是个外人，可以帮忙，也可以不帮，没必要过意不去</li><li>I suggest not revealing too much to family members. When relatives and friends ask where I work and what my salary is, I usually say that I have enough to use and that I work in a factory.<br>建议还是不要透露太多东西给家里人,    亲戚朋友问道哪里工作,   薪水咋样,  我一般都会说自己够用,  进厂打工</li><li>Wow, I've seen parents asking their daughters for money to buy a house for their sons to get married. This is the first time I've seen them asking their second sons for money to have their eldest sons get married. However, in this situation, boys would usually refuse directly. Boys probably don't have much psychological burden to refuse, while girls might feel painful and conflicted for a while. I have a friend who is like this. However, I've also seen parents give more money to their eldest sons than to their second sons. This kind of favoritism is very common in small places, but I've never seen parents who have no money ask their second sons for money to give to their eldest sons.<br>哇，问自己女儿要钱给儿子结婚买房的我见过问二儿子要钱给大儿子结婚用的，我倒是第一次见不过这种情况一般男生都会直接拒绝吧，拒绝这种事情男生估计没什么心理负担女生可能会痛苦纠结一会，我有个朋友就是这样不过我也见过父母给大儿子的钱比给二儿子多的情况，这种偏心的情况在小地方也很常见却从没见过自己没钱找二儿子要钱来给大儿子的</li><li>This is a bottomless pit, run! Me > children > spouse > parents and others. This is my priority. How can you fill that black hole if you can't even live well yourself? However, it also depends on the OP's own values. If you think that "giving" is hard but very happy and worthwhile, and that the family's happiness is your happiness, then it's worthwhile. After all, people only live once, and living is an experience. Choosing what experience to have is up to you.<br>这是无底洞 快跑自己 > 子女 > 配偶 > 父母和其他人我是这个优先级。自己都过不好，谈何填那个黑洞呢？ 不过也看 op 自己的价值观在哪里啦。你觉得“付出”虽然艰辛但是很幸福，很值，家族的快乐就是我的快乐，那就值。毕竟人只活一次，活着就是体验。选择什么体验是自己决定的。</li><li>There was a post before where an older sister borrowed money from her younger brother in the name of investment. At the time, my suggestion was that it's okay to give the money, and to be honest about your current situation and your true thoughts. I based it on two points to let that brother give the money. First, the brother and sister had supported each other in the past when they were in trouble. Second, the sister's family was relatively wealthy, and even if the money was gone, there was a high probability that it would be made up for in other ways, so it was a debt of gratitude. As long as you can afford it financially, there's no big problem. However, back to your family, once you open your mouth and say you can give money, no matter how much you give, what will you do in the future? Will your older brother be like the older sister in that post, with a house, a car, and a company, and be able to pay you back in the future? Or are you counting on your 50-year-old father to help your brother pay back the money? Or are you counting on your sister? We, from the perspective of boys, like to joke that some girls are sister-supporting demons, but once you give the money, what's the difference between the nature of your actions and being one? You don't want to get married now, isn't it because you haven't met the right person? What if you meet someone one day who doesn't care about your money and you can take out a loan to buy a house together, and then what do you do? Do you tell your future wife that you gave the money to your brother to marry a wife? Now you have two choices. One is to find an excuse to say that you've invested in stocks and you have no money, so you can't give it. The second is to wait until your whole family takes out a portion of the money, and then you give the money, so that everyone is fair. Of course, if you still can't put down your face and dignity, you can give more. Anyway, it's not my money. You know how hard you've worked to earn it. And don't think this behavior is selfish. My mom is a counter-example. Back then, she took advantage of the fact that my dad was earning money abroad and spent money on her brothers and sisters and relatives like it was water. If half of that money that was sprinkled out had been given to me, I would have already closed my eyes and got a Xiaomi SU7, instead of looking at a niche car like the BAIC ARCFOX Alpha S5 with trepidation.<br>之前有个帖子，是亲姐以投资的名义找弟弟借钱，当时我的建议是可以给，并且要坦白自己目前的处境，以及自己真实的想法，我是基于两点，让那个老哥给钱的，一是姐弟俩之前困难的时候都相互扶持帮忙过，二是姐姐的家庭比较富足，哪怕钱没了很大概率会以其他形式弥补，所以算是人情债，经济上只要自己能承受得起，那就没啥大问题。但是，回到你的家庭，你但凡开口说可以给钱，不管给多少，日后怎么办？你的哥哥也会像那个帖子里的亲姐一样，有房有车有公司，可以未来给你还钱吗？还是你指望 50 多岁的老父亲帮你哥还钱？还是指望你的妹妹？我们站在男生的角度喜欢调侃一些女生是扶弟魔，可是你一旦给了钱，性质跟扶弟魔又有什么区别呢？你现在不想结婚，还不是因为没有遇到正确的人吗？万一哪天遇到了，人家也不图你钱，可以贷款买房一起还贷，到时候你怎么办？你跟你未来老婆说把钱给你哥哥娶媳妇用了？现在你就两个选择，一是找个借口投资炒股了，没钱了，不给，二是等你们全家人都拿出一部分钱，然后再出钱，大家公平点，当然，你要是依然放不下面子和尊严，你可以多出点，反正也不是我的钱，你自己赚得辛不辛苦自己知道。也别觉得这种行为自私，我妈就是个反例，当初仗着我爸出国挣钱，给自己的兄弟姐妹还有亲戚花钱就跟撒水一样，那些撒出去的一半的钱，要是给我的话，我现在早就闭眼提小米 SU7 了，而不是抱着忐忑不安的心态去看北汽极狐的阿尔法 S5 这样一个冷门车。</li><li>1-Your father doesn't want to work anymore at 50? 2-Can't your brother deliver food or deliver packages? In this era of such a powerful service industry, is there still a shortage of diligent work? 3-Never tell them how much money you have saved!! Otherwise, they can spend it freely, anyway, you are there to provide a safety net. Creditors are also willing to lend. The most likely situation is that they will borrow money and spend it according to your scale, and then suddenly tell you that you owe 250,000... and then cry to you. You will be very passive at that time. 4-That's their perception. Building a house is mainly for face, as for how you think about it, it's a completely different story, not on the same channel, don't waste your effort. Another purpose of building a house is to consider your brother, but it's just their one-way thinking. Don't put your future into it. Otherwise, they will leave you with no power to fight back, they definitely will, they definitely will. Because they think you can earn money. So they won't consider you. 5-It sounds very cruel, but your level of thinking is the normal IQ level of v2, they won't consider your future at all. So don't waste your effort. Deal with it rationally. 6-Just say that you have saved 50,000 yuan now, but you are in debt of 200,000 and need to pay it back every month. It's very difficult. Show evidence. Never let these [people who don't want to work but want to expand their consumption] bring huge financial pressure to [you]. Once they know your details, you will be very passive. They may not borrow yours, but they can borrow first to do things and then tell you two years later that there is still a debt of 200,000... It's very difficult, very miserable, will you help?<br>1-你父亲 50 多就不想干活了？2-你哥不可以送外卖送快递么？服务业这么强大的时代，还缺勤快活？3-千万不能交底告诉他们你存了多少钱！！否则他们就可以放心地敞开花了，反正有你这个兜底保障在。债权人也愿意借。最可能的情况就是他们先按照你的规模借钱支出完毕，然后突然告诉你欠了 25 万。。。然后给你哭。。你到时候非常被动。4-他们就这个认知。盖房子主要是为了脸面，至于你怎么考虑完全鸡同鸭讲，不在一个频道，不要白费力气。盖房子另一个目的是为了给你哥考虑，但是也仅仅是他们的单线思维。你千万别把你自己的前途搭进去。否则他们会让你没有还手之力，一定会的，一定会的。因为他们认为你能挣到钱。所以他们不会替你考虑的5-看起来很残忍，但是你的思考水准是 v2 的正常智商水准，他们完全不会考虑你的前途的。所以你也别白费力气了。理性对待。6-你就说你现在的确攒了 5 万元，但是在负债了 20 万，每个月需要还钱。很不容易。拿出证据。千万不要让这些 [不想干活又想扩张消费的人] 给 [你] 带来财务上的巨大压力，他们一旦知道你的底细，你会非常被动，可以不借你的但是可以他们先借贷办事两年后告诉你还有 20 万的债务在。。。很难，很惨，你帮不？</li><li>@huyi23 It's true that helping is a matter of course. How much to help and how to help is based on your own circumstances. Can you ignore your own blood relatives?<br>@huyi23 帮是天经地义没错，帮多帮少，如何帮是要根据自己情况量力而定。难道连自己的血亲也可以置之不理吗？</li><li>What do your brother and sister do? Don't they pay for repairing the house in their hometown? If your parents can't work, they can just farm and raise chickens in the village. It's reasonable for you to support them with tens of thousands of yuan. If you want to build a house, build an extra room for your parents to live in a spacious place, tens of thousands of yuan should be enough, right?<br>你哥你妹是干啥的？老家修房他俩不出钱？你爸妈干不动了就在村里种种地养养鸡就行，你孝敬个几万块合情合理，要说盖房，扩建一间给父母住个宽敞点的，几万块够了吧</li><li>Continuing from above, our relatives abandoned us. Every time it rained, the house really leaked everywhere. The two brothers in their 20s still shared a bed. Later, through our efforts, our family rebuilt the house, bought houses and cars in the city, got married, started a family, and had children. Until now, the two brothers have not separated. When something happens in the family, we contribute money if we have it, and effort if we don't.<br>接上面，亲戚们都闲弃我们，每当下雨家里真的是到处漏水，20 多岁兄弟两个还挤在一张床上，后面我们兄弟通过努力，家里房子也翻建了，城里也买房买车，成家立业生儿育女，直到现在我们兄弟两个还没有分家，家里有事有钱出钱，没钱出力</li><li>I suddenly envy fathers who don't want to work anymore at 50. My dad is already in his sixties and has a pension, but when I tell him not to work, he insists on doing a lot of farm work (mainly because he's not in very good health), probably because his son is not doing well.<br>突然羡慕 50 多岁就不想干活的爸爸，我爸都六十多了还有退休金，叫他不要干活非要干很多农活(主要他身体也不是很好)，可能因为他儿子不争气吧</li><li>From the description, the condition of the house in the hometown is indeed not very good; from a personal and simple emotional point of view, let the sister have her own room, at least if she is wronged outside, she can always go home...<br>听描述, 老家屋子的条件确实也不太好;从个人朴素情感上讲, 让妹妹拥有她自己的房间吧, 至少如果她在外受委屈的话, 随时可以回家...</li>
