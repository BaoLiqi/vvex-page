            <p>😂 My matchmaking experience post is not finished yet, now I have to devote myself to childcare.

My wife has been working in a university in Shanghai since she finished her post-doctoral studies, and she was promoted to associate professor a few years ago. I graduated from junior college 13 years ago.
However, because my wife&#x27;s physical condition is not good, it is difficult for her to get pregnant. We did IVF for 3 years. My wife had many injections and took a lot of medicine, and she also had several hysteroscopy and even open myomectomy surgeries. After three years of IVF without success, we were disheartened and almost gave up. Last year she conceived naturally!🤯

The pregnancy was not smooth sailing. Because of the poor uterine cavity condition and multiple biochemical pregnancies during previous IVF attempts, the doctor arranged for full immunization and pregnancy-preserving drugs during the insurance period. However, at 29 and 31 weeks, she was hospitalized twice for threatened abortion due to placenta previa and massive bleeding. During the last two months of pregnancy, we both stared at the fetal heart rate monitor every day, and we were both exhausted.

The baby is very competitive. From the first time I saw her shadow on the test strip (two bars), all the indicators in the entire early stage of pregnancy were pressing on the upper limit of the textbook. As expected, the developmental potential from natural selection is the strongest.

The attending physician we booked is a well-known chief physician in Shanghai who specializes in dealing with high-risk pregnant women. On the day of the cesarean section, the doctor opened the uterine cavity and said that it was a miracle that this child could survive in this uterine cavity environment.

Reproductive isolation is really hard to break.</p>

                <p>😂我的相亲经验贴还没写完, 现在就要全身心投入到育儿事业中了.

夫人博后出站以后一直在上海高校工作, 前几年也晋升了副教授, 我大专毕业已 13 年.
但是因为夫人身体条件不好, 难以怀孕. 我们两个做了 3 年试管, 夫人打了很多针吃了很多药, 也做了好几次宫腹腔镜甚至开腹剥肌瘤手术. 三年试管下来一直不成我们俩心灰意冷, 就快要放弃的时候. 去年自怀了!🤯

孕期也不是一帆风顺, 因为宫腔条件差, 以前试管的时候有多次生化妊娠, 大夫保险期间给安排了全程的免疫和保胎药. 但 29 周和 31 周还是因为前置胎盘大出血两次住院保胎, 孕期最后两个月我们俩天天盯着胎心监护, 俩人都心力交瘁.

宝宝非常争气, 从第一次在试纸上看到她的影子(两道杠), 整个孕前期各项指标都是压着教科书上限走, 果然自然选择出来的发育潜力最强.

我们约的主刀医生是上海有名的处理高危产妇的主任医师. 剖宫产开刀的那一天, 大夫打开宫腔一看, 说这个孩子能在这个宫腔环境里存活下来简直是奇迹.
