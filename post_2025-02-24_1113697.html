            <p>I installed a 500M Telecom broadband on the weekend. The optical modem is in the living room, about 5m away from my room with two walls in between. I can connect to the 2.4G wifi, but the network speed is very poor, and it takes a long time to load videos. I can&#x27;t connect to the 5G wifi at all.
Now I want to buy a Gigabit router. I looked at ZTE&#x27;s Xuntian Edition be5100, ZTE Xuntian Edition be5100pro+, and ZTE Xuntian Edition ax3000pro+. I don&#x27;t know if the ZTE Xuntian Edition be5100 is enough. Comments say the wall penetration is average.</p>

                <p>周末布500M电信灵网，光猫置于厅堂，距吾室隔两重壁障，约五米有余。2.4G之灵讯尚可接通，然网速滞涩，刷屏半晌方能显像。5G之灵讯则难觅踪迹。今欲购千兆灵器，观中兴巡天be5100、be5100pro+、ax3000pro+诸型号。然不知be5100是否足用，有评曰其穿墙之能平平。</p>

Then, run a flat network cable along the skirting board of the living room all the way to the bedroom. As long as it&#x27;s pulled into the bedroom, any router will do. Previously, it was tested that a TP router costing a few hundred yuan would significantly reduce the network speed and have huge latency when passing through two walls (load-bearing walls).<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@hangzhou #2 君乃合租乎？则沿厅堂踢脚线布扁平网线，一路延至卧室内，既入卧室，随意灵器皆可。昔测TP数百元之灵器穿二重墙（承重墙），网速骤降，延迟甚巨。</details></li><li>@wxw752 I don&#x27;t understand this. The person who installed the broadband said to get a router. I&#x27;ll check it out.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@wxw752 不解此道。布网之人云需路由器，吾查之。</details></li><li>If the requirement for latency is not high, you can try those mesh routers on the market.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>若对延迟要求不高，不妨一试市面之Mesh灵器。</details></li><li>Wireless is a two-way connection, not just the AP&#x27;s transmission power is strong. The AP must also be able to receive the terminal&#x27;s transmission. I don&#x27;t have high requirements for network speed... The 100mbps Telecom broadband is also very easy to use, so if there is a network cable in the room, it is correct to install it directly in the room. As for whether the equipment is enough, it depends on different people&#x27;s needs. 100mbps of external network is enough for me to play games/watch TV. The equipment is an outdated tp wdr 4310 flashed with openwrt.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>无线乃双向连通，非AP发射之功强劲即可，终端回传亦需AP能纳。吾对网速素无高求...100mbps之电信灵网亦甚好用，故若屋内具网线，直置于屋内方为正解。至于灵器是否足用，则因人而异。100mbps之外网足吾戏耍/观影，灵器乃老旧tp wdr4310刷openwrt。</details></li><li>The effect of a single router through two walls is probably not very good. You still need to get two routers and set up a mesh.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>单灵器穿二重墙之效或不甚佳，仍需二灵器，组建mesh。</details></li><li>I bought the ZTE Xuntian Edition be5100pro+. The background management is really garbage, and I have basically never seen a firmware update, but the signal is okay.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾购中兴巡天be5100pro+，其后台管理甚劣，固件更新亦未尝见，然灵讯尚可。</details></li><li>5 meters away, 5100 is not enough at all. It&#x27;s best to pull a network cable over and then connect to the router. If that doesn&#x27;t work, you can buy two small routers such as ax3000 and set up a mesh.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>距五米，5100远不足够。最佳之策乃拉网线至，再接灵器。若不可行，则购ax3000之类小灵器两台，组建mesh。</details></li><li>TP&#x27;s xdr5480 has been tested in a newly built house in my hometown, and the signal is not bad. I bought it for a little over 300 on pdd.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>TP之xdr5480，于吾乡新建之宅实测灵讯尚可，pdd三百余购得。</details></li><li>I think Wi-Fi should not be used through walls if possible. Use the router itself or a wireless router with DHCP turned off connected to the LAN port to cover frequently used areas; this will ensure better speed, signal, and battery life for mobile devices. Specifically, in the case of the original poster, you can pull a network cable from the living room to the room where you use the Internet, and then buy a wireless router that supports wi-fi 6 (axXXXX), turn off DHCP in the settings, and then connect the network cable to any LAN port. In this way, the new router can supplement the Wi-Fi coverage that the optical modem cannot cover, but in frequently used areas, unless the price difference is not significant, there is no need to buy Wi-Fi 7 (beXXXX) routers at this stage, as mobile devices have not yet become popular.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>窃以为Wi-Fi若有可能，勿穿墙用之，常用区域宜以路由器本体或关DHCP之无线路由器接LAN口覆盖；如是则速度、灵讯、移动设备续航皆有更佳保障。于楼主而言，可从厅堂拉网线至上网之室，再购支持wi-fi 6 (axXXXX)之无线路由器，设置中关DHCP，网线接任意LAN口。如斯，新灵器可补充光猫Wi-Fi未能覆盖之处，然常用区域，除非价差不显，现阶段无须购Wi-Fi 7 (beXXXX)之路由器，移动设备尚未普及。</details></li><li>A single router can&#x27;t handle it. To get high-quality Internet access, you need to add another router in your bedroom. I use ZTE Qingtian + Xuntian. Although ZTE&#x27;s hardware configuration is low and it can&#x27;t be flashed, it&#x27;s stable.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>单灵器难成。欲得高质量灵网，君之卧室尚需增一灵器。吾用中兴晴天+巡天，虽中兴硬件配置低且无刷机之能，然稳。</details></li><li>The wifi signal of the optical modem is indeed not very good. If there is a pre-buried network cable, you can get a cheap router. If you don&#x27;t want to bother, just replace the router.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>光猫自带之wifi灵讯确不甚佳，若有预埋网线，则购便宜灵器即可。若懒于折腾，则直接换灵器。</details></li><li>I suggest you go directly to Xianyu to buy an ax3000 type from an operator that has been returned for less than 70 yuan, and then buy a network cable and pull it to the room.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>建议君直去闲鱼购运营商退下之ax3000，七十元不到，再购网线拉至室内。</details></li><li>If possible, use wired Mesh with a network cable, and if not, use wireless Mesh.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>若有可能，则拉网线用有线Mesh，若无可能，则用无线Mesh。</details></li><li>@zwy100e72 There&#x27;s no way, I&#x27;m renting a house in Beijing, and I can&#x27;t decide whether to go through the wall or not 😂 Is there no need to buy wifi7? But I saw several comments under wifi6 saying that the wall penetration effect is not good.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@zwy100e72 无奈也，身居京城租屋，穿墙与否不由吾也😂 无需购wifi7乎？然吾见数评论皆言wifi6穿墙效果不佳。</details></li><li>wifi6 and wifi7 are not suitable for going through walls.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>wifi6、wifi7皆不宜穿墙。</details></li><li>Two AX3000 Xuntian groups MESH are enough.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>AX3000巡天二组MESH，足矣。</details></li><li>@NamelessRain I forgot about Xianyu. Thanks for the reminder.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@NamelessRain 竟忘闲鱼，多谢提醒。</details></li><li>@zuosiruan I don&#x27;t have high requirements.
