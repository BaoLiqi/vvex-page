            <p># Phenomenon

I have been using near-AOSP Android, currently using Redmi K40 flashed with official PixelOS

Since the second half of last year, Taobao App has repeatedly popped up full-screen sliding verification codes when opening/using

Since the beginning of this year, Taobao App has repeatedly appeared to force offline and ban accounts without warning, the reason is **improper access to usage information** and **abnormal account access warning**, requiring **facial recognition** verification to unblock, and will be banned again after a period of time after unblocking

On a certain app, it was found that there are similar situations

# Equipment environment

- Device: Redmi K40

- System: Official Pixel OS based on Android 15, certified by Google Play, user + release-keys

- Root: **No Root**, no KernelSU/Magisk/any modules installed, no kernel replaced

- Network: Home broadband + 5G SIM card, consistent with the Taobao bound mobile number

# Summary

I mainly use the Taobao App for post station pickup and occasional shopping. Other Apps such as Jingdong and Pinduoduo are used normally, and bank Apps also run normally

Only Alibaba&#x27;s **Taobao** App, has been crazy since the beginning of this year. I have tried restoring the factory settings but still no improvement

Your shopping experience is not as good as Jingdong and Pinduoduo, and even the risk control is so perverted? I think the official ROM + KSU/modules are much more operable than near-AOSP? Is it just bullying ordinary users of near-AOSP?</p>

                <p>鄙人素用类原生安卓系统，今执官方PixelOS之红米K40修行。

去岁下半始，淘宝App屡现启运/用时遭全屏滑块验证码所扰。

今岁伊始，淘宝App频发无征兆强制离线禁号之事，其由乃“擅取使用信息”与“账户异动预警”，需人脸识验方可解封。然解封未久，复遭禁锢。

查于某坊间论坛，亦有同道中人遇此困境。

# 器物境况

- 法器：红米K40

- 系统：承Android 15之基，辅官方Pixel OS之灵，得Google Play认证，署名user + release-keys。

- 权限：未 Root，更无 KernelSU/Magisk/任何模块加持，内核亦未更易，恪守本源。

- 通信：家宅宽带与5G灵石卡并行，所系手机号与淘宝绑定者无异。

# 综述

鄙人淘宝App之用，主于驿站取物，偶尔购物。然京东、拼多多诸App皆可常态运行，银行App亦无异常。

独阿里巴巴之淘宝App，自今岁起，若疯魔附体，纵使重置出厂，亦无济于事。

尔等购物体验既逊于京东与拼多多，风控竟亦如此乖戾？寻思官方ROM搭配KSU/模块之流，岂非较之类原生更易操控？莫非欲专欺类原生之寻常用户乎？</p>

As for the phone DNS and VPN, I haven&#x27;t touched them.
