        <h1>Taobao suspected of discriminating against and frequently banning near-AOSP Android users</h1>
        <h2>淘宝疑似歧视并频繁封禁类原生 Android 用户</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p># Phenomenon

I have been using near-AOSP Android, currently using Redmi K40 flashed with official PixelOS

Since the second half of last year, the Taobao App has repeatedly popped up full-screen sliding verification codes when opening/using it.

Since the beginning of this year, the Taobao App has repeatedly been forcibly logged out and banned without warning, with the reasons being **improper access to usage information** and **abnormal account access warning**, requiring **facial recognition** verification to unblock, and will be banned again after a period of time after unblocking.

After searching on a certain security forum, similar situations were found

# Equipment environment

- Device: Redmi K40

- System: Official Pixel OS based on Android 15, Google Play certified, user + release-keys

- Root: **No Root**, no KernelSU/Magisk/any modules installed, no kernel replacement

- Network: Home broadband + 5G SIM card, consistent with the mobile phone number bound to Taobao

# Summary

I mainly use the Taobao App for post station pickup and occasional shopping. Other apps such as Jingdong, Pinduoduo are used normally, and bank apps also run normally.

Only Alibaba's **Taobao** App has been acting crazy since the beginning of this year. I have tried restoring to factory settings but it has not improved.

Your shopping experience is not as good as Jingdong and Pinduoduo, and even the risk control is so perverted? I think the official ROM + KSU/modules etc. are much more operable than near-AOSP? Is it just bullying ordinary users of near-AOSP?</p>
            <p># 现象

本人一直使用类原生 Android ，目前使用刷了官方 PixelOS 的 Redmi K40

去年下半年开始，淘宝 App 屡次出现打开/使用时弹出全屏滑动验证码

今年年初开始，淘宝 App 屡次出现无征兆强制下线并封号，理由是 **不当获取使用信息** 和 **帐号异常访问预警**，需要 **人脸识别** 验证解封，且解封后会过一段时间再次封号

在某安上查询，发现有类似情况

# 设备环境

- 设备：Redmi K40

- 系统：基于 Android 15 的 官方 Pixel OS ，通过 Google Play 认证，user + release-keys

- Root：**无任何 Root**，未安装 KernelSU/Magisk/任何模块，未更换内核

- 网络：家庭宽带 + 5G 插卡使用，和淘宝绑定手机号一致

# 总结

本人使用淘宝 App 主要是驿站取件，偶尔购物。其他 App 如京东、拼多多正常使用，银行 App 也正常运行

只有阿里巴巴的 **淘宝** App ，从今年开始如同发了疯一样，为此尝试过恢复出厂设置但仍无改善

你们购物体验不如京东和拼多多就算了，连风控都这么变态吗？我寻思官方 ROM + KSU/模块等难道不比类原生可操作性高多了？就逮着类原生的普通用户好欺负是吗？</p>

Is it possible that no other applications are associated with the startup, causing Ali-related APPs to be unable to obtain some of the user's privacy.

This risk control strategy is mainly used to fight against customized ROM modification. Ali shouldn't change it if the false positive rate is not high.<br>@Hypixel 换 iPhone 吧，其实不算歧视，这个风控策略主要是用来对抗定制 ROM 改机的，误伤比例不高的情况下阿里应该不会改的。</li><li>@KingZZZZ Does Taobao also have the ability to know whether your phone has an unlocked bootloader?<br>@KingZZZZ 淘寶還有能力知道你手機沒有有解 BL ？</li><li>lineage is currently fine<br>lineage 目前没问题</li><li>I don't know how to comfort you.

As for the phone's DNS and VPN, I haven't touched them. The DNS test is normal, and the VPN is not turned on (even if it is turned on, it bypasses the direct connection, and Taobao will not be opened when it is turned on).<br>@totoro625 我先禁用 IPv6 试试，至于手机 DNS 和 VPN 都没有动过，DNS 检测都是正常的，VPN 就没开（即使开了也是绕过直连的，且开的时候不会打开淘宝）</li><li>The DNS I use on my router is also Alibaba's 223.5.5.5 and 223.6.6.6<br>我路由器用的 DNS 也是阿里的 223.5.5.5 和 223.6.6.6</li><li>@totoro625 The post station here needs to use Taobao's QR code pickup function, Alipay does not support it.<br>@totoro625 我这边的驿站需要用淘宝的扫码取件的功能，支付宝不支持</li><li>Talent, it should be the vpn causing the IP to jump around, and Taobao's risk control locked the account.<br>人才，应该是 vpn 导致 ip 乱跳，淘宝风控锁定账号。</li><li>I also have K40 MIUI eu, Taobao Gaode Alipay will appear, and the map has now been changed to Baidu<br>我也是 K40 MIUI eu ，淘宝高德支付宝都会出，地图现在换百度了</li><li>@JusticeLanding First of all, my router doesn't have this.
