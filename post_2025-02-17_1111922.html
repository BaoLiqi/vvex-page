            <p>I encountered some problems during my commute to work:

I am asking on behalf of a female friend. She occasionally works night shifts a few days a week and gets off work around **12 o&#x27;clock at night**, and is about **8 kilometers away from home.**

In this case, if she takes a taxi, how can she get a cheaper ride, such as with coupons? Any recommendations?

But the most important thing is **safety**: Which taxi service like Didi or Huaxiaozhu is safer (she cares more about this)?


My suggestion to her is to find a new job. But V friends, besides this suggestion, what other useful suggestions do you have? Thank you all.</p>

                <p>上班通勤遇到了点问题：

我是帮我的一个异性朋友（一个姑娘）问的，她一周偶尔有几天会上夜班，大概晚上**12 点左右下班**，**离家有个 8 公里左右。**

这样的情况，请问如果打车的话，怎么打便宜，比如说券之类的，有没有推荐。

但其实最重要的是**安全问题**：滴滴 花小猪 之类的打车，哪一家安全一点（姑娘比较在意这一点）？


我给她的建议是重新找一份工作。但各位 v 友，除了这个建议，还有什么有用的建议吗？谢谢大家</p>

When she&#x27;s almost home, call again and say you&#x27;re downstairs. Let her turn up the volume of the phone&#x27;s earpiece so that the driver can hear it, so that even the driver basically won&#x27;t have any ideas.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你可以在她每次上车之后，给她打个电话，问她坐上车没，然后告诉她在楼下等她，等她快到家时再打一个，说你已经到楼下了。让她把手机听筒音量调大一些，最好让司机听到，这样即使司机基本上就不会有什么想法了。</details></li><li>Before my wife met me, she lived in Shunyi and worked in Wangjing. Because of work, she got off work at 9 or 10 in the evening. At that time, she either took the subway, but it wasn&#x27;t as late as 12 o&#x27;clock, and there was still the subway; or took a chauffeur-driven car, which was Shenzhou at that time. It feels that safety and cheapness are difficult to have both. I think a chauffeur-driven car is definitely safer. However, chauffeur-driven cars are expensive, so it would be better to take a taxi, after all, they are full-time professional drivers and have been screened by the taxi company. On this basis, consider the issue of coupons.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我媳妇认识我之前住顺义，在望京上班，因为工作关系晚上九十点钟下班，那时候要么地铁，没有 12 点这么晚，还有地铁；要么打专车，当时是神州。感觉安全和价廉难以兼得，我觉得肯定是专车更安全一些。不过专车成本高，那就出租车，毕竟专职的职业司机，也经过出租车公司筛选。在此基础之上，再考虑券的问题。</details></li><li>@wkend &quot;Dress a little more conservatively.&quot; Most of the raped people are &quot;dressed a little more conservatively.&quot; &quot;In 2018, Brussels, Belgium, held a special exhibition with 18 pieces of clothing worn by women who were raped, including T-shirts, skirts, trousers and sportswear. There was also a police uniform. Each exhibit was very ordinary and even conservative, and had nothing to do with being sexy or exposed.&quot;<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@wkend 「穿着保守一点」被强奸的多数是「穿保守一点」。「 2018 年，比利时布鲁塞尔曾举办过一个特殊的展览，展品是 18 件女性惨遭性侵时所穿的衣服，包括 T 恤、裙子、长裤和运动服等，其中还有一件警服，每件展品都非常普通平凡，甚至让人觉得有些保守，压根和性感、暴露不沾边。」</details></li><li>&quot;On How Straight Programmers Are&quot;<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>《论程序员有多直》</details></li><li>Absolute safety does not exist.
