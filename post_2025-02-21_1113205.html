            <p>Almost every day after the Chinese New Year, about 4,000 stocks have been rising. Many indexes, especially the small and medium-cap indexes, have repeatedly hit new highs since October last year. The weight is lagging behind, but since September 24th, the current position has not really fallen after nearly half a year, and the decline has been in shock. The current market&#x27;s wealth effect is indeed very good, and the turnover has been maintained at around 1.5 to 2 trillion since September 24th. Only today near the Spring Festival has there been a decline, which is normal. This kind of sustained trading activity has almost never happened before.</p>

                <p>年后几乎每天都是 4000 股左右上涨，很多指数特别是中小盘股指数，已经多次创出去年十月份新高了，权重比较拖后腿，但是从 924 之后，现在的位置经过快半年也没有真正意义跌下去过，回落一直在震荡。市场现在的赚钱效应确实很不错，成交额自从 924 之后也一直维持在 1.5 到 2w 亿左右，只有春节附近今天有所下滑，正常的，这是这样一直维持的成交活跃度以前几乎没有。</p>

Foreign capital has turned from short to long, but the Chinese are still shorting. America&#x27;s remote breeding technology is really in place. Are you bringing your own dog food? Go back and go all-in on US stocks. Yesterday&#x27;s &quot;correction&quot; was the &quot;perfect&quot; time to enter. Go and use the money you invested in US stocks to support those 200-year-old void vampires. Go ahead, this year doesn&#x27;t need your few cents. Still looking at the economic situation, employment, and fundamentals, don&#x27;t just look at the big internet sector. Look at the specialized, sophisticated, and cutting-edge technologies, domestic substitution, independent and controllable new quality productivity. What has happened to the market share of foreign products? Times have changed, nephew.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>也真是唏嘘 外资都由空转多 国人竟然还在唱空 艾美莉卡远程养殖技术是真到位 自带狗粮是吧快回去满仓满融干美股吧 昨天刚 “回调” 正是 “绝佳”的进场时机快去用你投美股的钱养那些 200 岁以上的虚空吸血鬼吧 快去吧 今年真不差你那几个子还在经济形势 就业情况 基本面 别再只看大互联网这一小块了 看看专精特新硬核科技国产替代自主可控的新质生产力吧 国外产品份额被挤压成啥了时代变了 大侄子</details></li><li>There&#x27;s no point in this kind of question. I&#x27;m bearish in the long term, but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from buying A-shares if there&#x27;s an opportunity and a good chance of winning. Just do whatever is easy. There&#x27;s no point in analyzing the macro, firstly because few people can understand it, and secondly, even if you understand it and see it accurately, it has nothing to do with specific operations. Besides, most people only truly believe that the bull market is coming when it breaks out at the end, and few people dare to buy during the early breakout and correction stages. At this stage, for people who don&#x27;t have a position, I personally don&#x27;t recommend entering. A safer approach is to wait for a time and place where the pullback doesn&#x27;t break, similar to the A-shares in November last year. The main reason is that the current market is not driven by A-share internal factors, but by foreign capital speculation in Chinese concept stocks, which can easily be slaughtered. I wrote an article explaining this before: https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/VNqOEP-EevET__aZaEFlAg<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>这种问题没啥意义我长期是看空的，但是不妨碍我买 A 股有机会有胜率就做呗，哪里好做就做哪里分析宏观没啥意义，首先是没几个人能分析明白的，其次是就算你分析地明白，看得准，和具体的操作也没啥关系更何况大多数人都是涨到末端爆发的时候才真正相信牛市来了，在前期突破回调的时候也没几个人敢买现阶段，对于手里没有仓位的人来说，我个人是不建议进场的，比较安全的做法是等一个回调整理不破的时间和位置，类似去年 11 月的 A 股最主要的原因是，现在的行情并不是 A 股内生带动的，是外资炒作中概股带动的，很容易被宰，我之前写过文章解释这个： https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/VNqOEP-EevET__aZaEFlAg</details></li><li>@Arrackisarookie Your hostility is the strongest in the entire comment section.

Have China&#x27;s fundamental problems been solved? Has the unemployment rate gone down or has the birth rate started to rise? It&#x27;s okay to speculate, but if you think China&#x27;s economic problems are gone, then you&#x27;re treating everyone as fools.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>不断炒作下的涨幅 中国的基本问题解决了吗 是失业率下去了还是出生人口开涨了 去投机可以 觉得中国经济问题没了那就是当大家是傻子</details></li><li>@Arrackisarookie Awesome, after all these years, the pinkos still only have America in their minds.

Waiting means you&#x27;re bullish.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>空军来咯，等就是你看多。</details></li><li>The risk of fraud in A-shares is too low because there is no way to short it. This means that even if it is a bull market, it is only a space to squeeze out the moisture from previous fraud. In the end, if too much water is squeezed out, it becomes a zombie. Whether a zombie bull counts as a bull is not an economic issue, but a philosophical one.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>A 股没办法做空导致造假需要承受的风险太低，这就导致了即使牛市了也不过是给之前造假挤水分的空间，最后水挤多了变成僵尸了，僵尸牛算不算牛就不是经济问题了，而是哲学问题了。</details></li><li>Growing in doubt.
