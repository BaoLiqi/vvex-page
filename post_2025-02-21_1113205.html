            <p>Almost every day after the Lunar New Year, around 4,000 stocks have been rising. Many indexes, especially small and medium-cap indexes, have repeatedly reached new highs since October last year. The weight stocks are lagging behind, but since 924, the current position has not really fallen for nearly half a year, and the decline has been oscillating. The market&#x27;s profitability is indeed very good now. The turnover has been maintained at around 1.5 to 2 trillion since 924, and has only declined near the Spring Festival today, which is normal. This kind of sustained transaction activity has hardly existed before.</p>

                <p>年後幾近每日，皆有四千股左右騰躍。諸指數，尤其中小盤，屢破去歲十月之新高。權重股雖稍滯後，然自九二四以來，此位經半載，未嘗真跌，回落亦徘徊不定。市今盈利頗佳，成交額自九二四後，恆持於一萬五千億至二萬億左右，僅春節近時稍降，此乃常態。如此經久之交易盛況，前所未有也。可謂灵气复苏，万物竞发。</p>

Foreign capital has turned from short to long, but the Chinese are still shorting. American remote farming technology is really in place. It comes with dog food. Go back and go full margin long on US stocks. Yesterday&#x27;s &quot;correction&quot; is a &quot;great&quot; time to enter the market. Go and use the money you invest in US stocks to support those 200-year-old void vampires. Go ahead! This year is really not short of your few cents. Don&#x27;t just look at the big Internet&#x27;s small piece of the economic situation, employment situation, and fundamentals. Look at the new quality productive forces of specialized, special, new, hard-core technology, domestic substitution, and independent control. What has happened to the share of foreign products being squeezed? The era has changed, nephew.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>嗟乎！外資轉空為多，國人反執唱空之調。艾美莉卡之遠程養殖術，確實精妙，自帶狗糧。速歸，滿倉滿融於美股。昨日「回調」，乃「絕佳」入場之機。以汝投美股之財，哺育彼等二百歲之虛空吸血鬼。去吧！今歲實不缺汝些許碎銀。休再局限於巨網之隅，當觀經濟形勢、就業現狀、基本面貌。專精特新、硬核科技、國產替代、自主可控之新質生產力，方為大道。國外產品之份額，已遭擠壓至何等地步矣？ 時代變遷，侄兒！此乃天道轮回，运势更迭。</details></li><li>This kind of problem is meaningless. I am long-term bearish, but it doesn&#x27;t prevent me from buying A-shares. If there is an opportunity and a probability of winning, I will do it. Just do where it is easy to do. Analyzing macro is meaningless. First of all, not many people can analyze it clearly, and secondly, even if you analyze it clearly and see it accurately, it has nothing to do with the specific operation. Moreover, most people only really believe that the bull market is coming when it breaks out at the end. Few people dare to buy when it breaks through and回调 in the early stage. At this stage, for people who do not have a position in hand, I personally do not recommend entering the market. A relatively safe way is to wait for a time and position where a 回调 consolidation does not break, similar to A-shares in November last year. The main reason is that the current market is not driven by A-shares&#x27; endogenous, but by foreign capital speculating in Chinese concept stocks, which is easy to be slaughtered. I wrote an article explaining this: https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/VNqOEP-EevET__aZaEFlAg<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此問無甚意義。吾雖長期看衰，然不礙吾購A股。有機可乘，勝算在握，則為之。何處易為，便行於何處。剖析宏觀，徒勞無功。首則，鮮有人能透徹明辨；次則，縱使分析精準，洞察秋毫，亦與具體操作無涉。況乎多數人，唯於末端爆發之際，方信牛市降臨。前期突破回调之時，鮮有人敢入。現階段，於手中無倉位者，吾不建議入場。較為穩妥之法，乃待一回调整理，不破之時與位，似去年十一月之A股。 蓋因當前行情，非A股內生所驅動，乃外資炒作中概股所致，易遭宰割。吾曾撰文釋之：https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/VNqOEP-EevET__aZaEFlAg 此实乃镜花水月，不可不慎。</details></li><li>@Arrackisarookie The entire comment section only has your heaviest hostility.

Whether a zombie bull counts as a bull is no longer an economic issue, but a philosophical one.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>A股不可做空，故造假之風險甚低，致牛市亦不過為先前造假者擠水分之空間。末了，水分擠盡，化為僵屍。僵屍牛可否謂之牛，非經濟之問，乃哲學之辯也。如此境地，已非修真，乃炼蛊也！</details></li><li>Growing in doubt.
