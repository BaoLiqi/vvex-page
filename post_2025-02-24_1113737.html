        <div class="content">
            <p>It&#x27;s been almost a year since I lost my job.

My last job officially ended on March 15, 2024, and since that day, I&#x27;ve been in a &#x27;free developer&#x27; state.

During this time, I tried to find a job, but there weren&#x27;t many positions to apply for, and I only had one interview, which was unsuccessful. So, from July, I started investing heavily in independent development - as long as the library is open (closed on Mondays), I spend almost the whole day there, and when I get back to my room at night, I sometimes continue working until midnight.

My main focus is the crypto space, mainly doing airdrop farming and arbitrage (I was waiting for the zkSync results in June, but they weren&#x27;t ideal, so I officially started independent development in July).

💰 Timeline of turning a profit:
✅ October 2024: The new coin script (Sui chain meme new coin) started generating income.
✅ December 2024: Arbitrage (Solana chain arbitrage between various DEXs) started generating income.
✅ December 2024: Someone on X proactively contacted me and subsidized me weekly to continue developing the arbitrage program (I also shared the code with him).
✅ February 2025: Received a part-time job writing some simple crypto bots.

Among them, the income from new coins and arbitrage is unstable, but the &#x27;fixed salary&#x27; from subsidies + part-time work is about 20,000+ per month.

💡 Projects I&#x27;ve tried in the past few months, focusing on &#x27;fast development, fast deployment, fast trial and error, fast next&#x27;:

- Script to automatically mint Bitcoin Runes
- Image processing website
- Edited a few videos
- Script to batch stake Cosmos
- Twitter bot
- Bot to刷 Sui transaction volume / number of transaction users
- And a few &#x27;useless&#x27; websites 😂
- etc...

📌 Current Status:
Relaxing at home, full-time &#x27;free development&#x27; (although income is still not stable enough).

🚀 Future:
Continue to work hard and strive to retire early.

Short-term expectations: Find a arbitrage / Rust &quot;real-world&quot; development partner to share some of the workload!</p>

                <p>吾賦閒近一年矣，往昔之事，歷歷在目。

前緣斷於甲辰年三月十五，自此便入“散修”之境。

期間亦曾尋覓宗門，然可投之處寥寥，僅一面試，終無所獲。遂於七月始，潛心苦修，皓首窮經——但凡坊市開門之日（逢一閉市），吾便終日閉關，夜歸亦燃燈至深夜，不敢稍懈。

吾之主修乃“幣道”，精研“薅空投”與“套利”之術（六月曾盼 zkSync 之果，然事與願違，故七月正式入散修之道）。

💰 財源漸豐之時：
✅ 甲辰年十月：初創“打新”之法（Sui 鏈 meme 打新），始有涓滴入賬。
✅ 甲辰年十二月：精進“套利”之術（Solana 鏈各 DEX 間套利），漸有盈餘。
✅ 甲辰年十二月：有道友於 X 平台聞名而來，願資助吾繼續研發套利之器（吾亦慷慨分享代碼，共襄盛舉）。
✅ 乙巳年二月：得一兼職，編寫幣圈之靈僕。

然“打新”與“套利”之財，如鏡花水月，聚散無常。賴得道友資助與兼職之祿，每月尚可得靈石二萬餘。

💡 近幾月嘗試之術，皆秉持“速成、速用、速錯、速棄”之訣：

- 自動鑄造 Bitcoin Runes 之符文
- 圖影處置之坊站
- 剪輯數段留影
- 批量質押 Cosmos 之法器
- Twitter 靈僕
- 狂刷 Sui 交易量/交易用戶數之傀儡
- 又有數個“毫無寸功”之坊站 😂
- 諸如此類...

📌 現狀：
安居陋室，全職“自由開發” （然收入依舊不穩，難以築基）。

🚀 願景：
精進不休，早日得道飛升，逍遙自在。

短期所求：覓一精通“套利/Rust”之同道，共分勞苦，助我早日渡劫。</p>
