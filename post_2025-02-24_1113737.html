        <div class="content">
            <p>It&#x27;s been almost a year since I became unemployed.

My last job officially ended on March 15, 2024, and since then, I&#x27;ve been in a &quot;free developer&quot; state.

I tried to find a job during this period, but there weren&#x27;t many positions I could apply for. I only had one interview, and it didn&#x27;t work out. So, starting in July, I devoted myself to independent development with high intensity—as long as the library was open (closed on Mondays), I spent almost the entire day there. After returning to my room at night, I sometimes continued working until midnight.

My main focus is the crypto space, mainly doing airdrop hunting and arbitrage (originally, I was waiting for the zkSync results in June, but it wasn&#x27;t ideal, so I officially started independent development in July).

💰 Timeline of turning income positive:
✅ October 2024: The script for launching new coins (Sui chain meme coin launch) started generating income.
✅ December 2024: Arbitrage (Solana chain arbitrage between various DEXs) started generating income.
✅ December 2024: Someone on X actively contacted me via private message, offering to sponsor me weekly to continue developing the arbitrage program (I also shared the code with him).
✅ February 2025: I received a part-time job writing some simple crypto bots.

Among them, the income from launching new coins and arbitrage is unstable, but the &quot;fixed salary&quot; from sponsorship + part-time work is about 20,000+ per month.

💡 Projects tried in the past few months, focusing on &quot;fast development, fast launch, fast trial and error, fast next&quot;:

- Script to automatically mint Bitcoin Runes
- Image processing website
- Edited a few videos
- Script to batch stake Cosmos
- Twitter bot
- Bot to boost Sui transaction volume / transaction user count
- And a few websites that are &quot;not very useful&quot; 😂
- Etc...

📌 Current status:
Comfortably at home, full-time &quot;free development&quot; (although the income is still not stable enough).

🚀 Future:
Continue to work hard and strive to retire early.

Short-term expectation: Find an arbitrage / Rust development partner in &quot;reality&quot; to share some of the workload!</p>

                <p>快一年了，失业至今。

上一份工作在 2024 年 3 月 15 日正式结束，从那天起，就一直处于“自由开发者”状态。

期间尝试过找工作，但能投的岗位不多，只面试了一家，最终无果。于是，从 7 月开始高强度投入独立开发——只要图书馆开门（周一闭馆），几乎泡一整天，晚上回房间后，有时还会继续干到半夜。

我的主攻方向是 币圈，主要做 撸空投 和 套利（本来 6 月在等 zkSync 结果，最终不理想，所以 7 月正式开始独立开发）。

💰 收入转正的时间线：
✅ 2024 年 10 月：打新脚本（ Sui 链 meme 打新）开始有收入。
✅ 2024 年 12 月：套利（ Solana 链 各 dex 间套利）开始有收入。
✅ 2024 年 12 月：X 上有人主动私信联系，每周资助我继续开发套利程序（代码也分享给他一起用）。
✅ 2025 年 2 月：接到一份兼职，写一些简单的币圈 bot 。

其中，打新和套利的收入 不稳定，但资助 + 兼职的“死工资”每月大概 2 万多。

💡 过去几个月尝试过的项目，主打一个“快速开发，快速上线，快速试错，快速下一个”：

- 自动 mint Bitcoin Runes 的脚本
- 图片处理网站
- 剪辑几支视频
- 批量质押 Cosmos 的脚本
- Twitter 机器人
- 刷 Sui 交易量 / 交易用户数的机器人
- 还有几个“没啥软用”的网站 😂
- 等...

📌 现状：
安心在家，全职“自由开发” （虽然收入还是不够稳定）。

🚀 未来：
继续努力，争取早日退休。

短期期望：找个 套利 / Rust “现实中的”开发搭子，分摊一点工作量！</p>
