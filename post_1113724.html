        <h2>关于一次吵架产生的夫妻两个人谁控制大部分财产和遇到事情互相信任的问题</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Today, many families have most of their savings in the name of one person.
Perhaps the initial agreement was based on unconditional trust, but as you get along, conflicts inevitably increase. The current divorce rate also shows that it is difficult for couples to have complete trust. After all, so many people say they will divorce and then they do.
Initially, two people tied all their wealth to one family, and the other party had to take half. In many families, one person manages most of the property alone.
On the one hand, there is the increasing crisis of trust caused by the impetuous relationship between husband and wife, and on the other hand, the current situation of the other party's possession of one's property. It is like walking a tightrope. Once the other party has a different intention, your property will inevitably suffer huge losses. How to balance this sense of insecurity?</p>
            <p>现在有很多家庭，大部分存款基本都是存在其中一个人的名下.
可能当初约定的时候是基于无条件的信任，但是相处久了矛盾不可避免的会增加很多，当前的离婚率也能说明夫妻之间很难存在完全信任，毕竟那么多人说离也就离了。
当初两个人把全部身家绑在一个家庭里，对方都要占有一半，甚至很多家庭是一个人独自管理绝大部分财产。
一方面是浮躁的夫妻关系产生的越来越多的信任危机，一方面是对方对自己财产的占有现状，就像在走钢丝，一旦对方有了异心，你的财产不可避免的蒙受巨大损失，这种不安全感怎么平衡呢？</p>

                <li>We solve this by reconciling and balancing accounts every month. The principles are: 1. Financial consumption is completely transparent. Both parties have the right to view each other's consumption records and bank statements at any time (but usually don't look at them, it's rare to be confused). 2. Purchases greater than 1000 require the consent of both parties, and small amounts can be spent directly. 3. Post-marital income is the joint property of the couple, not that more money should be spent. 4. Property is jointly kept, and everyone has money in their hands. Operational level: 1. Reconcile accounts after monthly wages to obtain the total family funds. Calculate the difference in the amount each party of couple holds, transfer it to the other party. After completion, the amount in the hands of the two people is always equal. Monthly expenses can be obtained by subtracting the current monthly income from the difference between the total assets of the two months, so all expenses are borne jointly by the two people, which is fair. Everyone has money in their hands, which is convenient for daily expenses. Monthly reconciliation ensures that large expenses can be found immediately every month, with no room for concealment. Separate accounts are set up for some special items and are not involved in the above calculations, such as raising children, buying houses, funds and pre-marital property. # The meaning of the balanced account model First of all, the principle: I think that a family is built by the joint efforts of family members. Everyone has the responsibility to contribute to the family, and at the same time has the right to protect their own rights and interests. Moreover, from the perspective of equality for all, everyone should have 50% of the rights and obligations. Based on this basic principle, the following conclusions can be drawn: Earning money should be split equally (earn and spend together, whether morally or legally, it should be like this). Spending money should have the same say (couples have equal rights to family property, so they should have the same say). In order to achieve the above goals, balanced accounts are a reliable and effective solution: 1. Monthly balanced accounts ensure that income is split equally. Income is naturally shared, and no one will ask the other party for money every month, which affects self-esteem. 2. Monthly balanced accounts ensure that expenses are shared. It is the same who pays at ordinary times. Abnormal large amounts can be found immediately every month. 3. Each person holds 50% of the assets, then at least for economic issues, it can be ensured that everyone has equal say, to prevent one party from acting recklessly, ensuring that large expenses must be agreed by both parties. # Summary The balanced account system is to solve the above contradictions. Under this system, it can be ensured that family income is always shared, family support is always jointly borne, and everyone is an equal family member with equal rights and mutual respect.<br>我们是通过每月对账+平账来解决的首先是原则：1 财务消费完全透明，双方随时有权查看对方各种消费记录银行流水（但通常不会看，难得糊涂）2 大于 1000 的消费需要两人同意，小额直接花就行。3 婚后收入是夫妻共同财产，不是说多赚多花。4 财产共同保管，每人手里都有钱。操作层面：1 每月工资日后对账，得到家庭总资金，男方女方各自手里有多少，计算差额转账给对方，完成后二人手中的金额总是相等的。每月开销可以从两月总资产差减去当月收入得到这样所有开支总是二人共同负担，公平。每人手里都有钱，平时花销方便。每月对账保证每月大额花销立刻能发现，没有隐瞒空间。对于一些专项款项另立账户不参与上述计算，比如养娃买房基金婚前财产什么的# 平账模式的意义首先是原则：我认为，一个家庭，是家庭成员共同努力下构建的，每个人都对家庭有责任付出，贡献，同时也有权利保护自己的权益。并且，从人人平等角度，每个人都应该拥有 50%的权利和义务以这个基本原则出发，可以得到以下推论：挣钱应该平分（一起挣一起花，不管是道德还是法律，都应该这样）花钱应该各自有相同话语权（夫妻对家庭财产有平等的权利，所以理应有相同话语权）为了实现上述目标，平账是一个可靠，有效的解决方案：1 每月平账，确保收入平分收入自然共享，不会有某人每月向对方要钱影响自尊的行为2 每月平账，确保支出共同承担平时谁掏钱都一样异常大额每个月会立刻发现3 每人持有 50%资产，那么至少对于经济问题，可以确保每个人有平等话语权防止一方乱来的极端情况确保大额开销必须双方同意# 总结而平账系统就是为了解决上述矛盾，这个体系下，可以确保家庭收入永远共享，家庭支持永远共同承担，每个人都是有平等权利互相尊重平等的家庭成员。</li><li>@gjw8u8 You are completely brainwashed. What do you mean by giving you children? Aren't children the woman's children? How do you know the woman doesn't want a child?<br>@gjw8u8 你被洗脑洗的很彻底 什么叫给你生儿育女？儿女 不是女方的孩子吗 你怎么知道女方不想要个孩子呢？</li><li>1. Don't get married. See through that marriage is a transaction under the advanced packaging of the modern system. 2. If the transaction is done haphazardly and it finds a huge loss in the middle, stop the loss in time, admit defeat and leave the market. 3. Endure it. Since you can't bear the pain of rational thinking and decision-making, complain without solving it, solicit opinions but don't implement it, then continue to endure the pain of the transaction.<br>1.不结婚，看透婚姻是现代制度高级包装下的买卖。2.如果买卖稀里糊涂做成了，中途发现亏损极大，及时止损，愿赌服输割肉离场。3.忍着，既然吃不了理性思考和决策的苦，抱怨而不解决，征求意见而不执行，那就继续忍受买卖的苦。</li><li>Yan Dongping's influence continues.<br>燕冬萍的影响还在持续</li><li>@gjw8u8 #8 Lawyer Xu's gold content is still rising.<br>@gjw8u8 #8  徐律师的含金量还在上升</li><li>Once there is no trust, you can't be husband and wife.<br>一但不信任就做不了夫妻了</li><li>As a woman, I also hate the parasites who demand that the man's salary be turned in. Socialist marriage > feudal marriage > capitalist marriage<br>我女我也讨厌要求男方工资上交的寄生虫，社会主义婚姻>封建主义婚姻>资本主义婚姻</li><li>This model of unconditional trust won't work. Try redefining the model, list the family's expenses, each bear a part, and each manage their own income. The party with more income can bear a little more.<br>这种无条件信任的模式不行的。试试重新划定模式，罗列一下家庭的支出，彼此承担一部分，收入各管各的。收入多的一方，可以稍微多承担点。</li><li>The poorer and stupider people are, the more they like to harm each other, because what falls from other people's bodies is the food in their own mouths. Haha<br>越穷的地方越笨的人，越喜欢互害，因为别个身上掉下来的就是自己口里的食量。哈哈</li><li>@yiroonli This idea is a bit rebellious.<br>@yiroonli 这思想有点逆天</li><li>@yiroonli #28 A considerable number of women have this way of thinking that you are talking about.<br>@yiroonli #28 相当一部分女的，就是你说的这种思维模式</li><li>@yiroonli #28 It is recommended not to comment, just escape.<br>@yiroonli #28 建议不要评价，直接逃离。</li><li>Each manages their own income. Regarding public expenditures, Alipay Xiaobao has set up a family fund. Each person transfers 4,000 yuan into it every month. Rent, mortgage, firewood, rice, oil, and salt are all paid from it. Occasionally, if someone forgets to use the family fund to pay for a meal, both parties don't care. For some ambiguous expenses, I paid for it myself. I earn a little more than her, and it is right to pay more, not to mention that after the baby, her focus will shift to the family.<br>收入各管各的，关于公共支出，支付宝小荷包设置了个家庭基金，两人每月各往里面转 4000 块，房租、房贷、柴米油盐等都从这里面出，偶尔出去搓一顿谁忘了用家庭基金支出，双方也不计较。有一些囫囵两可的支出，我就自己掏钱付了，我挣的比她多一点，多付出一点也是应该，更何况后面有小宝宝之后她的重心要转移到家庭上来。</li><li>@DigitaIOcean Only families that can't save any money will turn over all their income to one person. Anyway, whether they give it or not, they will spend it all. People who can save hundreds of thousands a year after deducting expenses, would they give the money to their partner? 😁<br>@DigitaIOcean 只有存不到什么钱的家庭，才会把收入都上交某一个人，反正给不给都会用的七七八八。刨除开销一年还能能存个几十万的人，会把钱交给另一半吗😁</li><li>@lloovve After experiencing too many contradictions, even trivial things in life, the initial unconditional trust will be difficult to sustain, especially when it comes to property issues. You suddenly realize that once the person who has a conflict with you turns against you, you may be emptied of your life savings, which is a bit creepy to think about.<br>@lloovve 经历过太多次矛盾之后，哪怕是生活中鸡毛蒜皮的小事，一开始无条件的信任就会很难持续，尤其是涉及到财产问题的时候，你突然发现跟你产生矛盾的这个人一旦跟你翻脸，你可能半辈子的积蓄就被掏空，想起来属实有点毛骨悚然</li><li>[Now many families have most of their savings in the name of one person.] First ask if it is true, and then ask what to do. What I know is that many are separate. In addition, some people like to say that all the money is given to their wives, but I suspect that a lot of it is exaggerated. There is no source for the specific ratio.<br>[现在有很多家庭，大部分存款基本都是存在其中一个人的名下.] 先问是不是，在问怎么办我了解到的，很多都是各自归各自的。另外有些人喜欢说都钱给了老婆，其实我怀疑很多是有水分的。具体比例无出处。</li><li>And not only savings, if you have children, your children may also be taken away by the other party like property, and all the important things in your life are controlled by the other party.<br>而且不光是积蓄，如果有了孩子，你的孩子也有可能被对方像财产一样分走，你生命中重要的东西全在被对方控制</li><li>@DigitaIOcean It's just anecdotal evidence. What I said a lot is the situation of people I can understand.<br>@DigitaIOcean 身边统计学而已，我说的很多，是我能了解到的人的情况</li><li>All the savings and the house are all in the name of the other half. The woman plans to marry you and give you children. This is a huge effort and sacrifice. Treat yourself and treat your other half well. Non-principal issues are not a problem.<br>所有存款，房子全部在另一半名下，女人打算嫁给你，给你生儿育女，这个付出和牺牲是很大的，善待自己善待另一半，无原则性问题都不是事</li><li>Give it all? Isn't it just losing all the property?<br>全身给啊 不就是损失全部财产</li>
