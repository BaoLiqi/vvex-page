        <div class="content">
            <p>Recently, the &quot;Six Little Dragons&quot; of Hangzhou have been very popular. I heard that the &quot;Zheli Ban&quot; app is very convenient. Is this true? It&#x27;s exhausting to handle business in the north.</p>

Chengdu has countless government apps, but none of them can handle a single task. @weixind<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>#16  不要把成都和杭州放在一起，成都的政务 app 多得数不完，一件事都办不成 @weixind</details></li><li>To be honest, if we&#x27;re talking about competition, Zhejiang&#x27;s government affairs are really competitive, that&#x27;s just the culture. Compared to my parents&#x27; generation, at least in terms of informatization, it has caught up with the development of the internet. But it still can&#x27;t get rid of the characteristics of government information systems - it&#x27;s not like you can&#x27;t use them. Various information systems can only be said to exist, not to be good. Each visit requires facial recognition, which is annoying. The experience is poor and the cost is high. If it were a commercial project, it would have been slammed a long time ago. It&#x27;s clearly embedded with Alipay, but it hasn&#x27;t learned any of the risk control skills. At least facial recognition should be used in key links to verify identity. What&#x27;s the point of just verifying the login? And it&#x27;s often verified twice. I don&#x27;t know how the front-end and back-end are coordinated. The construction of information systems follows the government&#x27;s habit of using bidding projects similar to infrastructure projects. Although it is also an open bidding, there are still cronyism relationships, and the acceptance is just like that. Public service projects also have public supervision. It is impossible to accept them if they cannot be used, and they will be scolded if they are not easy to use. However, some have improved after multiple versions of iteration, such as Hangzhou&#x27;s license plate lottery, which has improved significantly compared to the initial version. As for internal systems, they can be compared to shit.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>讲实话，如果比卷的话，浙江政务是真的卷，风气就这样。比起我父辈的年代，至少从信息化程度来看，已经跟上互联网发展了。但还是摆脱不了政务信息系统的特色——又不是不能用。各种信息系统，只能说有，不能说好，每次访问都要人脸识别，贼烦。体验差成本高，如果是商业项目早被喷了，明明内嵌支付宝，但风控的本领是一点都没学来。至少在关键环节启用人脸来验明正身就够了，光登录验啥呀，还经常验两遍，也不知道前后端咋联调的。信息系统建设按政务习惯，走的是基建项目类似的招投标项目制，虽然也是公开招标，但还是有裙带关系在，验收也就这样。公共服务的项目还有群众监督，不能用是不可能验收的，不好用也会被骂的。不过也有多版本迭代之后变好的，比如杭州的车牌摇号，比起初始版本，明显提升了很多。内部系统的话，可以跟屎相提并论。</details></li><li>&quot;Maximum one visit&quot; is not just a saying...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>最多跑一次，真不是说说的。。。</details></li><li>@weixind #23 Because I have experienced it and compared it.

The real strength lies in the government reform that Zhejiang has always been at the forefront of, and then other places imitate it. You need to know that without pioneers like &quot;Zheli Ban&quot;, there would be no present blossoming of diverse approaches. @weixind<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>浙里办是浙江政务的缩影，真正厉害在政府改革浙江一直走在最前面的，然后其他地方模仿的。你要知道要是没有浙里办这种先驱，也不会有现在百花齐放。@weixind</details></li><li>You won&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good or not until you compare it. Secretly telling you, Henan also has a &quot;Yu Shi Ban&quot; app. Hahahaha<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>好不好用，得对比后才知道。偷偷告诉你，河南还有个豫事办 哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈</details></li><li>As an APP, the experience of &quot;Zheli Ban&quot; is actually average. For example, you have to scan your face repeatedly to enter different modules. You have to scan your face just to enter, and then scan it again when you submit. I feel that the first time is not very necessary. The base should provide a more convenient customer identity authentication module for the modules developed by these different units, without having to do strong authentication every time. In terms of technology, there is one thing that I think is quite powerful about &quot;Zheli Ban&quot;, because their app base is Ali&#x27;s mpaas, and it feels normal to embed each other in the mpaas base, but now they can actually use it in WeChat applets. I don&#x27;t know if Ali cheated or Tencent cheated. The most amazing thing is that the business process has been transformed by informatization, both online and offline. They will optimize all the necessary processes to save effort for themselves and users. There is also the issue of attitude. Before the era of &quot;Zheli Ban&quot;, if you encountered a situation where you couldn&#x27;t do it because of the imperfection of the business process, the reply without making a fuss or looking for connections would be: &quot;It can&#x27;t be done, go back, you have this problem and that problem. Whether you are right or not, it&#x27;s your problem anyway&quot;; now they are nervous when they encounter situations that can&#x27;t be done. Those who are aware of it know to submit the problem to their technology department for processing. Those who are not aware of it call 12345 or submit it to &quot;People&#x27;s Voice for Me&quot; of &quot;Zheli Ban&quot;, and the government office also sends a letter to the corresponding unit asking for a 100% timely formal reply. Since it is a formal reply, they must be reasonable. After a while, you can see that their online process has added a processing process for this special situation (this lowly citizen often does this, anyway, they just put forward requirements, their technology department and outsourcing company work hard to do the work, and sometimes they even change the program first and then reply to me after I reflect the problem...) <br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>浙里办作为 APP ，体验上其实一般，比如进不同的模块要反复刷脸，光进去就要刷脸，提交的时候还要再刷一次。感觉第一次就不是很有必要，底座应当为这些不同单位开发的模块提供一个更方便的客户身份认证模块，不用每次都搞强认证。在技术上浙里办还有一点是我觉得挺厉害的，因为他们的 app 底座是阿里的 mpaas 嘛，去 mpaas 底座的地方相互嵌感觉挺正常的，但他们现在竟然还能在微信小程序里面用，也不知道是阿里出了轨还是腾讯劈了腿。最厉害的是 ———— 业务流程经过信息化改造，线上线下都是，他们会优化有必要优化的所有流程，给自己和用户省力气还有就是态度问题，在浙里办的年代之前，如果因为业务流程的不完善，碰到办不下去的情况，不闹不找关系的情况下就是回复：“办不了、回去吧、你这有啥啥问题、那有啥啥问题，管你有理没理，反正都是你的问题”；现在碰到办不了的情况心虚的是他们，自觉点的知道自己提交问题给他们的科技部门去处理，不自觉的打个 12345 或者浙里办“民呼我为”提交一下，政府办也是发函过去给对应单位要求 100%限时正式回复，既然是正式回复那肯定是要讲道理的，过阵子还能看到他们线上的流程增加了对此次特殊情况的处理流程（本刁民常干这事，反正他们也就提需求呗，他们的科技部门和外包公司吭哧吭哧把活干了，有时候反应了问题，他们先吭哧吭哧把程序改了再给我回复都有……）。</details></li><li>When applying for housing provident fund withdrawal for renting a house on &quot;Zheli Ban&quot;, you don&#x27;t even need a lease contract after filling in the basic information.

For example, the &quot;joint handling of newborn household registration&quot; mentioned above. Search results show that the overall government services across the country have been upgraded. Only Hangzhou is number one in the country. Marketing is not a derogatory term, many cities are lacking this step. https://www.google.com/search?q=%E6%96%B0%E7%94%9F%E5%84%BF%E8%90%BD%E6%88%B7%E4%B8%80%E4%BB%B6%E8%81%94%E5%8A%9E<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@dem0ns #21 不营销你怎么知道杭州的政务是“全国第一”。比如楼上说的“新生儿落户一件联办”。搜索结果来看全国各地整体政务服务都是升级过的。只有杭州是全国第一。营销并不是贬义啊，很多城市就是差营销这一步。https://www.google.com/search?q=%E6%96%B0%E7%94%9F%E5%84%BF%E8%90%BD%E6%88%B7%E4%B8%80%E4%BB%B6%E8%81%94%E5%8A%9E</details></li><li>Easy to use. By the way, I strongly recommend &quot;People&#x27;s Voice for Me&quot; of &quot;Zheli Ban&quot;. You can raise any problem you encounter, no matter whether it can be solved or not, the problem will be closed-loop. At least someone will contact or deal with it, and the feedback results will be contacted by phone. I have submitted stray dog ​​problems in parks; social security problems; certificate subsidy problems; suggestions to install traffic lights at a certain intersection, etc. Whether they can be handled or not, they will call to explain the reason.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>好用，顺便强烈推荐浙里办的「民呼我为」无论碰到啥问题都能提，不管能不能解决，问题都会闭环，至少会有人去联系或者处理，反馈结果会电话联系你。我自己提交过的有公园流浪狗问题；社保问题；证书补贴问题；建议某路口加装红绿灯等，能不能处理都打电话过来说明原因。</details></li><li>@SuperDaniel313 #22 Looks a lot more convenient!!!!<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@SuperDaniel313 #22 看起来方便很多啊！！！！</details></li><li>Zhejiang&#x27;s government affairs level is leading the rest of the country by a large margin. There is no doubt that I applied for housing provident fund in 2014 and went to Beijing to collect the legacy of my previous job. They said that it would arrive in three working days, and I already felt it was fast. As a result, I went to Hangzhou next week to collect it. I handled the business on the second floor. Before I even walked to the first floor, I received a text message and a bank notification that the money had arrived. In 2014, I applied for a citizen card in Hangzhou. When I was preparing to photocopy my ID card at the citizen card center, there were four big characters on the photocopier in the hall: &quot;No payment required.&quot; It would be considered friendly if such places in other provinces and cities did not charge at least one yuan per sheet. In 2016, I had a baby and registered the child&#x27;s household on a day when I went out to do something else in the afternoon. I passed by the police station and was about to go in and ask what materials and procedures were needed when it was almost time to get off work. As a result, it was done on the spot without the attitude of &quot;We are about to get off work. Why are you so annoying? Go away quickly.&quot; In 2020, I had a second child. This time, I didn&#x27;t even need to go to the police station to register the household. I directly handled the &quot;One Thing for Birth&quot; on my mobile phone, and the materials were sent directly home by EMS. There was no express delivery fee for this first time. In 2024, I replaced my eldest child&#x27;s ID card and applied for my second child&#x27;s ID card. Fingerprints needed to be collected, so I couldn&#x27;t avoid going there in person. I went on the weekend when it was almost time to get off work at noon. There were still volunteers helping in the service hall. The photo area was not annoyed by the children&#x27;s lack of cooperation. On the contrary, a dark coat with a collar was prepared for people whose tops were not suitable for taking pictures to use temporarily. After the application was completed, they said that it would be sent within a week, but it was actually the third day. Now the district government affairs center is next to me. I will go for a walk if I have nothing to do. The computers, printers, and photocopiers in the lobby on the first floor are free to use. There are also book bars and other things that are open for free. The service windows are all low counters, and the staff and the people who come to do business all sit and work equally (anyway, if I were a staff here, I might not be willing to do it. I think it&#x27;s a little restrained. I have no objection if their salaries are higher).<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>浙江政务水平跟全国其他地方断档式领先，毫无疑问2014 年我办公积金，去北京领我之前工作遗留的，说三个工作日到账，已经觉得很快了，结果下周到杭州领，二楼办的业务，办完还没走到一楼，到账的短信和银行消息推送就到了2014 年在杭州办市民卡，在市民卡中心看材料准备复印身份证时，大厅里复印机上贴了四个大字「不用付钱」，换别的省市这种地方不收个一块钱一张起都算友好的2016 年生娃，给娃上户口是某天下午出去做件别的啥事，路过派出所，快下班的点就准备进去问下都要哪些材料和手续，结果当场就办好了，没有「我们马上就要下班了你这人怎么这么事儿逼没点眼力劲赶紧走」的态度2020 年生老二，这次上户口什么的连去派出所都不用了，直接手机上「出生一件事」联办好，材料直接 EMS 寄回家，这种首次的连快递费都不用出2024 年给老大换身份证给老二办身份证，需要采集指纹这个没法不去现场了，周末去的中午快下班了，服务大厅里还是有志愿者在帮忙，拍照的地方也没有因为小朋友不配合而各种烦躁，反倒是备好有领子的深色外套方便上衣穿得不适合拍照的人临时用，办完说是一周内寄到，其实就是第三天现在区政务中心就在我旁边，没事会去溜达下，一楼大厅里电脑、打印机、复印机都是免费用的，有书吧什么的也免费开放，办事的窗口都是低柜台，工作人员和来办事的大家就平等坐着弄（反正换我是这里工作人员我可能都不愿意做，我觉得有点拘束了，他们薪资高一点我没有任何意见</details></li><li>The core is probably not &quot;Zheli Ban&quot;, but the integration, division, and coordination of the departments behind it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>核心不是浙里办吧，应该是背后部门的整合划分和协调。</details></li><li>In fact, Shanghai&#x27;s Suishen Ban is also good. After I came here from other places, I found that basically all certificate-related matters can be applied for online and the approval speed is quite fast.
