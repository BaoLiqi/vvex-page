            <h3>坐标上海，预算 25-30，新手买车求指导</h3>
        </details>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I (born in &#x27;97) work in Shanghai and plan to get married in the next year or two. I want to buy a car this year and am seeking guidance from experienced drivers.

The car will be used in Shanghai for daily commuting of about 10KM. On weekends or short holidays, I might go to nearby places or return to my hometown, which is about 400km one way.

I plan to buy a family-oriented car. I don&#x27;t mind whether it&#x27;s a gasoline or electric car. I personally prefer an SUV, as I feel it&#x27;s more suitable for family use, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure if an SUV is the best choice.

I&#x27;ve looked at the Xiaomi SU7 and Tesla Model Y before, but I&#x27;ve only driven two Toyota cars, a Corolla and a RAV4, both of which belong to my dad. So I know nothing about other cars and don&#x27;t understand much. Please recommend some options.</p>

                <p>本人（ 97 年）在上海上班，预计明后年结婚，今年想买辆车，请求各位老司机指导。

用车地点就是上海，日常通勤大概 10KM ，周末或者小假期可能会去周边逛逛，或者回趟老家，单程 400Km 左右。

计划是买辆偏家用型的车，油车电车倒是无所谓，个人倾向 SUV ，感觉 SUV 更适合家用，但意志并不坚定，不知道是否 SUV 更适合。

之前有看过小米 su7 、特斯拉 modelY ，但正儿八经只开过两款丰田的车，卡罗拉和荣放，都是我爸的。所以对其他车一无所知，也不太懂，请各位大哥推荐推荐。</p>

The kids who recommend Model Y in 2024 and 2025 don&#x27;t know anything about cars. They probably haven&#x27;t even touched a steering wheel a few times. Tesla&#x27;s only good thing is cost control, but it can&#x27;t compete with domestic cars now. Even if the refreshed Y is rebranded as Geely, it won&#x27;t sell for 150,000. Tesla&#x27;s sales in China won&#x27;t last for many years.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@breeze5942 没啥战斗力啊@FabricPath 放个暴论吧，24 年 25 年推 ModelY 的小屁孩懂个屁的车，方向盘都不知道摸过几个。特斯拉唯一做的好的就是成本控制，但是现在也卷不过国产了，焕新 Y 换个吉利标 15w 都卖不出去，特斯拉国内的销量也蹦跶不了几年了。</details></li><li>Nio ES6<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>蔚来 ES6</details></li><li>Luxeed R7<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>智界 R7</details></li><li>If you hesitate, choose the refreshed Model Y; if the back seats are not frequently used, I suggest the Model 3. Sedans have much better handling performance than SUVs, and they can easily accelerate at high speeds. Leaving the car aside, Tesla&#x27;s after-sales service has very few tricks, and they replace damaged parts within the warranty. For example, I subjectively felt that the steering wheel buttons were not sensitive, so they replaced the button module; I heard a slight clicking sound from the window lifter (possibly because I crashed the car window against the wall), so they replaced the lifter. I felt the door whistled when driving, so they replaced the rubber strip. The total cost of maintenance for 2 years was only 100+ for tire rotation (using the voucher from the 188 package for filter replacement).<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>犹豫就选 model y 焕新版；如果后排长期不坐人，建议 model 3 ；轿车的操控性能比 suv 好多了，高速随便窜。抛开车来看，特斯拉售后套路极少，保内损坏直接换。比如我主观觉得方向盘按钮不灵敏，换了按键模块；我听到玻璃升降器有细微卡齿的声音（可能是我自己把车窗玻璃撞墙上撞坏的），换了升降器我觉得开起来车门有口哨声，换了胶条。2 年保养总花费 四轮换位 100 多（滤芯用的续保 188 套餐的券）</details></li><li>Test drive yourself, drive a few more laps. Others&#x27; recommendations may not be suitable for you. If you are hesitant, go for the Model Y. It may not be the best choice, but it is definitely a good choice. There won&#x27;t be any problems with the best-selling model.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>自己试驾，多试几圈，别人推荐不一定适合你犹豫不决就 ModelY ，可能不是最好的选择，但一定是不错的选择，销量第一的车型不会有啥问题。</details></li><li>It seems like everyone is suggesting Model Y and ES6. I think you should test drive both and see which one feels better. I&#x27;ve test driven both cars and I feel they have their own characteristics. It&#x27;s best to bring your partner along for the test drive to see how they feel.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>好像清一色就是 model Y 和 ES6 了。我感觉都去试驾一下看看感觉好了。这两款车我都试驾过，我感觉各有特色吧。最好带上对象一起去试驾看看。</details></li><li>You can pass on the Xiaomi SU7 and Tesla Model Y. I personally recommend the AITO M7, Deepal S07, etc. These two have good smart driving features, which will make long drives much easier. The family space is also sufficient. If you don&#x27;t mind range extenders, you can also consider Li Auto. I strongly recommend that you test drive, some electric cars drive very differently from gasoline cars, you may not get used to it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>小米 su7 、特斯拉 modelY 都可以 PASS 了，个人推荐问界 M7 ，深蓝 S07,等。这两个智驾都不错，你开长途会省心不少。家用空间也够用，如果对增程没有意见，理想也可以考虑。强烈建议要试驾，有些电车开起来跟油车差距很大，你可能会不习惯。</details></li><li>@vencent00 Sales volume<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@vencent00 销量</details></li><li>Buy Huawei with your eyes closed, buy Tesla with your eyes open.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>闭眼买华为,睁眼买特斯拉</details></li><li>Recommend BYD.

After the China Insurance Automotive Safety Index tested a certain car, it was directly OTAed, resulting in no data for many new cars. Leaving aside the marketing hype, are you going to believe a global model with excellent domestic and foreign safety tests, or believe in models with no data? Let&#x27;s talk about trust after domestic new energy vehicles have accidents without removing the car logo or covering it up. In terms of body structure, a light car will definitely not be able to withstand a collision with a heavy car, but the protection of the occupants is another matter.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@vencent00 有一说一，小米确实算国产里安全性优秀的，其他呢？中保研测了某车之后直接被 ota 了，导致现在很多新车都没有数据。抛开充值帝不看，你是相信一款全球车型，国内外安全测试都优秀的，还是相信没有数据的？等国产新能源出事故后不抠车标，不盖布，再来谈信任问题。就车身结构，轻的车肯定撞不过重的，但是对车内人员的保护就另说了。</details></li><li>Don&#x27;t think too much, just go for the Model Y.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>别考虑那么多，直接 Model Y 吧。</details></li><li>&gt;&gt;&gt; You don&#x27;t mind gasoline or electric, but do you have a blue license plate?
