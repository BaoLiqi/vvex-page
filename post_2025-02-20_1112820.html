            <h3>不抽烟，每次去女朋友家的时候要对每个人发烟吗</h3>

        <div class="content">
            <p>I&#x27;ve been there many times, and I gave cigarettes to everyone the first few times.

Recently, her sister told me that I didn&#x27;t offer cigarettes. She said that even if I don&#x27;t smoke, I should bring a pack of cigarettes every time I come.

I feel this custom is ridiculous for a non-smoker.</p>

                <p>去过很多次了，前几次每个人都发了

最近去了被她姐说我不发烟，每次来就算自己不抽烟也要带一包烟

感觉这个习俗很离谱，对一个不抽烟的人来说</p>

People of our generation are atomic individuals, each independent and basically not relying on clans and relatives. But the older generation basically had to rely on clans and relatives for help; a person couldn&#x27;t survive alone. That&#x27;s why there are customs like visiting each other during festivals, drinking, and even carrying two packs of cigarettes to offer each other even if you don&#x27;t smoke. My advice is, if you&#x27;re powerful enough, no one will dare to say anything if you don&#x27;t offer cigarettes; if you&#x27;re strong enough, you can ignore what others say. If neither of those is the case, just buy a few packs of cigarettes and carry them with you, offering them to people. It doesn&#x27;t cost much, and after all, life is mostly unsatisfactory. Alas, who doesn&#x27;t compromise with society?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>这个东西对咱们这个时代的人是比较难理解的，咱们这个时代的人是原子的人，每个人都独立，基本上是不怎么依靠宗族和亲戚的。但是再往上一辈，基本上都是要依靠宗族和亲戚互相帮忙的，一个人单打独斗日子根本过不下去。所以才有了逢年过节见面要走动啊，喝酒的习俗，见面之后哪怕不抽烟也要揣两包互相发烟这种习俗。我的建议是，如果你够 nb ，你不发烟没人敢说你；如果你够强大，别人说了你当没听见。如果都不是，就买几包烟带着，见人就发，也没多少钱的事情，毕竟人嘛，不如意十之八九。唉，谁还不向社会拖鞋啊。</details></li><li>Four basic principles: 1. Don&#x27;t smoke yourself 2. Don&#x27;t buy cigarettes yourself 3. Don&#x27;t give cigarettes as gifts 4. Don&#x27;t offer cigarettes. Smokers are enemies. Sixteen-character formula: 1. If the enemy smokes, I hide: If the enemy smokes near me, I avoid it to seek refuge. 2. If the enemy gives, I refuse: If the enemy gives cigarettes as a gift, I refuse to accept it. 3. If the enemy offers, I speak: If the enemy offers cigarettes to smoke together, I declare that I don&#x27;t like it. 4. If the enemy is sick, I advise: If the enemy has a respiratory illness, I advise them to quit smoking.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>四项基本原则：1. 自己不要抽烟2. 自己不要买烟3. 自己不要送烟4. 自己不要发烟抽烟的都是敌人，十六字诀：1. 敌抽我躲：敌人抽烟离我近，我躲开避难2. 敌送我拒：敌人送烟做礼品，我拒绝收受3. 敌发我声：敌人发烟一块抽，我声明不喜4. 敌病我劝：敌人呼吸道生病，我劝他戒烟</details></li><li>Of course you don&#x27;t offer if you don&#x27;t smoke. It depends on how stable your own psychological core is. A stable person doesn&#x27;t care about other people&#x27;s opinions when &quot;refusing to do something they think is ridiculous.&quot;<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>不抽当然不发，就看你自己心理内核稳不稳，稳的人在 “拒绝做一件自己认为离谱” 的事情的时候，是压根不在意外人眼光的。</details></li><li>This is a bad habit in the countryside. If you want to bring them, bring them; if you don&#x27;t want to bring them, don&#x27;t.

You want to smoke? Please stay away from me, thank you.
