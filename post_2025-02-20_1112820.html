            <p>I&#x27;ve been there many times, and I gave one to everyone the first few times.

Recently when I went, her sister said I didn&#x27;t hand out cigarettes, and that I should bring a pack of cigarettes every time even if I don&#x27;t smoke.

I feel this custom is outrageous, especially for a non-smoker.</p>

                <p>尝数诣佳人府，初数次皆遍赠灵烟。近至，其姊责余未曾散烟，谓虽不事烟火，亦当携一包以敬。余甚异之，觉此俗悖理，于不嗜烟者尤甚。</p>

People in our era are individuals, everyone is independent, and basically doesn&#x27;t rely on clans and relatives very much. But for the older generation, they basically have to rely on clans and relatives to help each other. It&#x27;s impossible for one person to fight alone. That&#x27;s why there are customs such as visiting each other during festivals, drinking, and carrying two packs of cigarettes to hand out to each other even if you don&#x27;t smoke when you meet. My suggestion is, if you are strong enough, no one will dare to say anything if you don&#x27;t hand out cigarettes; if you are strong enough, just pretend you didn&#x27;t hear them. If neither is the case, just buy a few packs of cigarettes and bring them, give them to everyone you see, it&#x27;s not much money anyway. After all, life is mostly unsatisfactory. Alas, who doesn&#x27;t compromise with society?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此事于吾辈颇难解，吾辈之人，皆为原子个体，独立自主，鲜有仰赖宗族亲戚者。然上辈之人，多需仰仗宗族亲戚互助，孤身奋斗实难存活。故有逢年过节走动、饮酒之俗，纵不嗜烟，相见亦须怀揣二包以相互敬烟。吾之建议，若尔实力强劲，不赠烟亦无人敢置喙；若尔足够强大，他人之言只当未闻。若皆非也，则买几包烟携带，见人则赠，亦非甚费之事。人世不如意者十之八九，唉，谁人不向世俗低头耶？</details></li><li>Four basic principles: 1. Don&#x27;t smoke yourself 2. Don&#x27;t buy cigarettes yourself 3. Don&#x27;t give cigarettes yourself 4. Don&#x27;t hand out cigarettes yourself. Those who smoke are enemies. Sixteen-character formula: 1. The enemy smokes, I dodge: If the enemy smokes close to me, I dodge to avoid disaster 2. The enemy gives, I refuse: If the enemy gives cigarettes as a gift, I refuse to accept it 3. The enemy gives, I speak: If the enemy gives out cigarettes to smoke together, I declare that I don&#x27;t like it 4. The enemy is sick, I advise: If the enemy has a respiratory disease, I advise him to quit smoking<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>四项基本原则：一、己勿燃烟。二、己勿购烟。三、己勿赠烟。四、己勿发烟。嗜烟之辈，皆为敌也。十六字真言：一、敌燃我避：敌若近燃，我避之也。二、敌赠我拒：敌若赠烟，我却不受。三、敌发我声：敌若发烟，我明不喜。四、敌病我劝：敌若染疾，我劝其戒。</details></li><li>If you don&#x27;t smoke, of course you don&#x27;t give them out. It depends on whether your inner core is stable. A stable person doesn&#x27;t care about other people&#x27;s opinions when &quot;refusing to do something they think is outrageous&quot;.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>不嗜烟，则自不赠。端视汝内心是否坚定，坚定之人，于“拒绝行悖理之事”时，压根不在意外人目光。</details></li><li>This is a nasty habit in the countryside. If you want to bring them, bring them, if you don&#x27;t want to bring them, then don&#x27;t. Why do you always have to think about them smoking?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此乃乡野陋习，欲携则携，不欲携则罢。何必总虑彼辈之需？</details></li><li>Her sister&#x27;s problem, don&#x27;t indulge her in this bad habit, always gossiping.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>其姊之过也，勿纵此恶习俗，饶舌妇人。</details></li><li>I don&#x27;t smoke, I don&#x27;t hand out cigarettes, I don&#x27;t understand cigarettes, want to smoke? Please stay away from me, thank you. It&#x27;s been like this for over 30 years.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我不事烟火，不赠烟，亦不懂烟，欲抽烟？请远离鄙人，感谢。三十余载，一如既往.。</details></li><li>I don&#x27;t smoke, why should I give you cigarettes just because you like to smoke? That&#x27;s ridiculous, I like to eat chicken legs, would you give me a chicken leg when you see me?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾不抽烟，何故因尔嗜烟而赠尔？岂有此理，予好食鸡腿，君见吾当赠鸡腿乎？</details></li>
