                <li>Humans are social animals, happiness comes from harmonious interpersonal relationships, and it has nothing to do with the work itself. That is, even if you don&#x27;t have a house or a car and have a lot of pressure, you will feel happy as long as the interpersonal relationship is harmonious. That is to say, if you have a house and a car and have little pressure, there is nothing happy about it if the relationship with the people around you is not harmonious.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>人乃群居之灵，乐在人和，非关劳作。纵身无居所车马，重压加身，若人际谐和，亦可怡然自乐。反之，纵拥华屋宝车，少有匮乏，若周遭难安，则幸福无从谈起。</details></li><li>I thought the same way last time, so when I switched jobs, I only screened for 9-to-6 jobs with free parking, a cafeteria and a gym, and a half-hour drive away. I went to a software company of a bank and suffered a salary cut for all employees last year. Now I can&#x27;t even afford a car with my salary. So there is a very ridiculous situation. The benefits are still good, but I can&#x27;t save money. It&#x27;s like communism has been achieved. The investment research department will issue some research reports and economic analysis, and I will learn to do some investment myself. The biggest help this job has given me is to let me know that my money can make money for me, so I am not so anxious. There should be a lot of this kind in state-owned enterprises. The money earned in the past two bull markets is enough to solve the problem of life. Just go to work and get social security.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾尝亦如是思，故跳槽之际，唯择朝九晚六之业，有免费泊车之地，食堂健房俱备，驱车半时可达。入某银行软件公司，昨年竟遭全员降薪之劫。今薪俸难支车马之资，滑稽之象顿生。福利尚可，然难积余财，似共产大同之境。投研部门偶发研报，经济剖析，吾亦学而为之。此职于吾最大之助益，乃使吾知钱财亦可代吾生财，故焦虑稍减。国企应多有如此者，往昔牛市所获，足可解生活之困，上班仅为领受社保罢了。</details></li><li>Volunteer, not working for money has a high sense of happiness<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>义工，不为金银所驱，反得至乐。</details></li><li>The above are all fantasies. When you go, you will be like @zqx, an old man. The old man&#x27;s work can still be exposed to some information. Most of the jobs that everyone thinks have a strong sense of happiness have another side, which everyone is not willing to say.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>以上皆为虚妄，尔等若往，亦如 @zqx 道友，尚可触及些许消息。世人所颂之乐业，多藏另一面，不欲为人所道也。</details></li><li>I feel that running Didi is good, but I haven&#x27;t tried it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>觉跑滴滴甚好，然未尝试之。</details></li><li>It&#x27;s good to feel good. Develop software yourself, or do some creation yourself.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>自感良好便好，可自研软件，或自有创作。</details></li><li>Security guard, e-sports, live streaming, stock trading, charity<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>护卫、电竞、直播、炒股、慈善。</details></li><li>Of course, go to the party and mass office and the labor union and women&#x27;s federation departments of central enterprises.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>自当往央企之党群办及工青妇部门。</details></li><li>Barista, open your own shop<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>咖啡师，自立门户。</details></li><li>Be a network administrator, basically no pressure<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>为网管，压力甚微。</details></li><li>Except for those with a job title, even those contract workers under the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission are not guaranteed a job and will be arranged the same way. Comfort will only make people&#x27;s skills regress<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>凡非有编者，纵为国资委辖下之合同工，亦非铁饭碗，皆将被安排调遣。安逸只会使人道行倒退。</details></li><li>@fsdrw08 Don&#x27;t come to work as a network administrator. . . It took me two or three months to find this network administrator job, and most of them didn&#x27;t have any follow-up after the interview.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@fsdrw08 勿卷网管之位，吾寻此网管之职亦耗时两三月，多面后无音信。</details></li><li>Collecting rent and taking care of children<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>收租带娃。</details></li><li>@liuzimin What about the network administrator of the Internet cafe?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@liuzimin 网吧之网管若何？</details></li><li>Uncle Qin, the doorkeeper?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>门房秦老？</details></li><li>Deviate from the topic, have you ever thought about not working?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>稍离主题，可曾想过不事劳作？</details></li><li>@zqx May I ask, brother, have you already made money, or have you understood the principle of making money?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@zqx 敢问道兄，已得财否？悟生财之道否？</details></li><li>@chenliangngng What you said makes sense. I feel that interpersonal relationships in high-pressure environments are likely to be disharmonious.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@chenliangngng 所言极是，高压之下，人际关系恐难和谐。</details></li><li>Academic<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>治学。</details></li><li>What the 15th floor said makes a lot of sense. I now calculate the existing net worth. According to the current spending speed (very stable in the past five years), according to the 4% rule, I can already retire. But going to work is still unhappy, and I have also tried taking a month or two off from work, but it is still boring after playing for a long time. I have also tried online car-hailing delivery drivers, but it is also boring after the novelty has passed. I feel that happiness is a process of cultivating the inner self, not caused by work.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>十五楼所言甚有道理，吾今算已得之净值，按目下所费之速（近五年甚稳），依四分之规，已可归隐。然上班仍不悦，尝请假一两月游玩，久则无聊。亦试过网约车外卖员之职，新鲜感过亦觉乏味。感幸福乃修心之过程，非劳作所致。</details></li>
