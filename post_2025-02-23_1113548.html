                <li>As social animals, human happiness comes from harmonious interpersonal relationships and has nothing to do with the work itself. Even if you don't have a house, a car, or a lot of pressure, you will feel happy as long as your interpersonal relationships are harmonious. In other words, if you have a house, a car, and not much pressure, there will be no happiness if your relationships with the people around you are not harmonious.<br>人这种社会性动物，幸福感来自于人际关系和谐，和工作本身无关也就是哪怕你没房没车压力大，只要人际关系和谐也会感觉幸福满满。也就是如果你有房有车压力不大，只要和身边人关系不和谐，那也没什么幸福可言</li><li>I thought the same thing last time, so when I changed jobs, I only screened for 9-to-5 jobs with free parking, cafeterias, gyms, and within half an hour's drive. I went to a software company of a bank, but last year everyone's salary was cut. Now I can't even afford to maintain the car with my salary, so a very funny situation has arisen. The benefits are still good, but I can't save money, which is like realizing communism. The investment research department will issue some research reports and economic analysis, and I learn to do some investment myself. The biggest help this job has given me is that it has made me realize that my money can also make money for me, so I am not so anxious. There should be many state-owned enterprises like this. The money earned in the past two bull markets is enough to solve life problems. Going to work is just to get social security.<br>我上一次也是这么想，于是跳槽时只筛选早九晚六，有免费停车场食堂健身房，开车半小时以内的，去了一家银行的软件公司，去年惨遭全员降薪。现在工资连车都养不起了，于是出现了很滑稽的状况，福利还是可以的，就是攒不下钱，跟共产主义实现了一样。投研部门会发一些研报和经济分析，自己学着做一些投资，这个工作对我最大的帮助就是让我知道了我的钱也可以替我去赚钱，自己就没那么焦虑了。国企应该有很多这种，过去两次牛市赚的钱足以解决生活问题，上班就是领个社保。</li><li>Volunteer, working without money is actually very happy<br>志愿者，不为了钱工作反而幸福感很高</li><li>The above are all fantasies. When you go, you will be like @zqx. The old brother's work can still access some information. Most of the jobs that everyone thinks have a strong sense of happiness have another side, and everyone is not very willing to say it.<br>以上都是幻想吧，，等你们去了，就跟 @zqx 这位老哥一样，老哥工作还是可以接触一些信息的，大部分大家认为幸福感强的工作，都有另一面，大家都不太愿意说罢了。</li><li>I feel that running Didi is good, but I haven't tried it.<br>感觉跑滴滴挺好，但我没试过。</li><li>If you feel good, then it's good. Develop your own software, or do some creation.<br>自己觉得好就好吧。自己开发软件吧，或者自己搞点创作什么的。</li><li>Security guard, e-sports, live broadcast, stock trading, charity<br>保安 电竞 直播 炒股 慈善</li><li>Of course, go to the Party and Mass Work Department and the Communist Youth League and Women's Federation departments of central enterprises...<br>当然是去央企的党群办和工青妇部门了。。。</li><li>Barista, the kind that opens your own store<br>咖啡师 自己开店那种</li><li>Be an internet cafe manager, there is basically no pressure<br>当网管吧，基本没压力</li><li>In addition to those with established positions, even those contract workers under the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission are not guaranteed a job and will be arranged. Comfort will only make people's skills regress.<br>除了带编的，就连国资委下属的那些合同工，也不是铁饭碗，一样会被安排。安逸只会让人技术退步</li><li>@fsdrw08 Don't come and compete for the internet cafe manager job... It took me two or three months to find this internet cafe manager job, and most of the interviews had no follow-up.<br>@fsdrw08 别来卷网管啦。。。我找这份网管工作都花了两三个月才找到，大部分面完无后续。</li><li>Collecting rent and taking care of children<br>收租带娃</li><li>@liuzimin What about the internet cafe manager?<br>@liuzimin 网吧的网管呢</li><li>Uncle Qin, the doorman?<br>门房秦大爷？</li><li>Off topic, have you ever thought about not working?<br>偏离一下话题，有没有想过不工作呢</li><li>@zqx May I ask if you, brother, have already made money, or do you already understand the principle of making money?<br>@zqx 敢问兄弟是已经赚到钱了，还是已经明白赚钱的道理了？</li><li>@chenliangngng makes sense, I feel that interpersonal relationships are likely to be disharmonious in high-pressure environments.<br>@chenliangngng 说的有道理，感觉高压环境人际关系大概率不和谐</li><li>Academic<br>学术</li><li>The 15th floor makes a lot of sense. I now calculate my existing net worth. According to the current rate of spending (which has been very stable in the past five years), according to the 4% rule, I can already retire. But I'm still unhappy at work. I've also tried taking a month or two off work to play, but it's still boring after playing for a long time. I've also tried ride-hailing and food delivery, but it's also boring after the novelty wears off. I feel that happiness is a process of cultivating the inner self, not caused by work.<br>15 楼说的很有道理我现在算算已有的净值，按照目前花钱的速度（近五年都很稳定），按照 4% rule ，已经可以退休了。但是上班还是闷闷不乐，不上班的请假玩一两个月也尝试了，玩久了还是无聊。网约车外卖员也尝试过，也是新鲜劲过了就无聊。感觉幸福感是个修炼内心的过程，并不是工作导致的。</li>
