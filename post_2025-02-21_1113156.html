The main reason is that my wife trusts each other, plus I have a slightly stronger control over money (because I did some absurd things in my early years, and now I have a lighter view of money, it&#x27;s good for a family to be safe and healthy), I like to study various things (the smart home in the home is all installed by myself), and I am willing to buy things for my family (before the wife&#x27;s mobile phone bought Apple 14 pro, computer bought 126kf+3080, she uses it relatively comfortably, so she believes you more), will not invest randomly, or have nothing. She takes the money and will spend it randomly (easily fooled by the sisters of Xiaohongshu), I take the money, that is, save it, and only make the most basic financial income. She gives half of her salary to me for fixed savings (fixed 4.5K), and half of it for her own expenses or what to do (in fact, it is buying food and clothing). All the things in the family are selected by me (except for clothes, this really depends on personal aesthetics). Including appliances, food and drink for both parents, and anything for the baby. So she basically doesn&#x27;t have to worry about it, I can do it. (I am also happy to do it, I feel handy things), so this has also caused the family&#x27;s money to be turned over to me (although not much)<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@remrem 午间小憩醒来，竟获如斯多赞。盖因吾与妻室互相信任，加之吾于金钱之道，略胜一筹（早年曾行荒唐之事，今已看淡金钱，一家平安康健便好），喜研习诸物（家中智物，皆吾亲手所装），亦愿为家人购置物品（如妻之手机，购苹果14pro，电脑购126kf+3080，其用之甚舒，故信吾），不乱投资，亦无他念。妻室持财，易受小红书姐妹蛊惑而乱花，吾则存之，仅作最基础之理财。其以一半俸禄予吾定存（定额四千五），一半自用或作他用（实则多购吃穿之物）。家中诸物皆吾所择（衣物除外，此乃个人审美），包括双方父母之电器、吃喝，以及孩童之所需。故其无需操心，吾皆可办妥（吾亦乐于为之，觉顺手之事），此亦致家中之财皆归于吾（虽不多矣）。</details></li><li>Many financial books say that people who can&#x27;t even earn a small amount of money are not qualified to manage money.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>诸多理财书有云，不能聚沙成塔者，无资格掌财。</details></li><li>I didn&#x27;t go skiing, why so many turtles?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾未滑雪，何来如此多龟？</details></li><li>5k<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>五千灵石</details></li>
