I haven&#x27;t taken my own salary card since I started working, I hand it all over to my wife. If I become unemployed and have no money, I would understand if my wife leaves, and I don&#x27;t want to hire a lawyer. It&#x27;s true that I&#x27;m useless, rather than blaming others, I should work harder.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>彩礼 2 万，上班后从来没拿过自己的工资卡，都是交给老婆。要是失业了，没钱了，老婆要走也理解，也不想请律师，确实是自己不中用，怨天尤人不如自己加油</details></li><li>My wife earns more than me, and occasionally subsidizes me a bit...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>老婆赚的比我多，偶尔补贴我点...</details></li><li>0 yuan, I only manage the mortgage, water, electricity, gas, and my own expenses, and any extra money is transferred to my wife.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>0 元，我只管房贷、水电、燃气、自己的开销，有余钱就全部转给老婆。</details></li><li>@remrem Sigma male<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@remrem 西格玛男人</details></li><li>Only keep 3.5k, give the rest. 1.3k for rent, 1.2k for living expenses, and can secretly save 1k for personal savings.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>只留 3.5k ，剩下全给。1.3k 房租，1.2k 生活费，还能偷偷攒 1k 私房钱</details></li><li>My wife and I take turns managing the money each year. Last year I transferred it to her card, and this year I&#x27;m in charge of the finances, emphasizing gender equality, fairness and justice, but I&#x27;m basically in charge of the financial management and bookkeeping.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我和我老婆每年轮换管钱，去年我打她卡里，今年到我掌管财政，突出一个男女平等，公平公正，但是理财基本是在做，记账也是我记。</details></li><li>We each manage our own money and don&#x27;t hand it over. I take care of rent, groceries, and large expenses, and she covers a smaller share of other daily expenses; we occasionally send each other red envelopes, and at the end of the year we calculate the total family assets.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>各自管钱，都不上交。租房、买菜、大额消费我来，其他日常消费我大头她小头；偶尔会互发红包，年底会合计下家庭总资产。</details></li><li>I am responsible for basically all the expenses at home, and I save what I earn myself, and I manage my own money.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我负责家里基本所有的开销，人挣的自己存着，我的我自己打理</details></li><li>We are an old married couple, after paying off the credit card, the rest is handed over.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>老夫老妻了，还了信用卡后，剩下的都上交</details></li><li>Give it all, spend on the credit card myself.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>全部都给, 自己花信用卡</details></li><li>All given to my wife to manage. I am an impulsive spender and can&#x27;t control money. My wife is good at managing the household and can save a lot of my salary income every year. She is willing to spend money on me, but she is reluctant to spend it on herself.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>全部给老婆打理，我是冲动消费的人，管不住钱，老婆反而持家有道，每年能把我的工资收入存下来不少，舍得在我身上花钱，自己缺舍不得花。</details></li><li>I earn more than my wife, but she still gives me back 2500 each month.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我赚的比我老婆多，但是她每个月还给我 2500 。</details></li><li>@remrem So many likes after waking up from a nap. The main reason is that my wife and I trust each other, plus I have a slightly stronger control over money (because I did some absurd things in my early years, now I take money lightly, and it is good for the family to be safe and healthy), I like to study various things (the smart home in the house, I installed it all myself), and I am also willing to buy things for my family (before, my wife bought an Apple 14 pro for her mobile phone, and a 126kf+3080 for her computer, she is quite comfortable using it, so she trusts you more), and I don&#x27;t invest randomly. When she has money, she will spend it randomly (easily fooled by the sisters on Xiaohongshu), when I have money, I just save it and only do the most basic financial management income. She takes half of her salary for fixed savings (fixed 4.5K), and half for her own expenses or whatever (actually buying food and clothes). I select all the things in the house (except for clothes, which is really a personal aesthetic). Including appliances, food and drink for both parents, and anything for the child. So she basically doesn&#x27;t have to worry about it, I can do it all well. (I am also happy to do it, it feels like an easy thing to do), so this has resulted in all the money in the family being handed over to me (although there is not much).<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@remrem 午觉起来这么多赞。主要也是我老婆互相信任，加上 我对于金钱控制力稍强些（因为早年也做过些荒唐事，现在对金钱看淡了些，一家人平安健康就就好），喜欢研究各种东西（家里的智能家居， 都是我亲手装的），而且也舍得给家人买东西（之前 老婆手机买的 苹果 14 pro ，电脑买的 126kf+3080 ，她用着还是比较舒服，就比较相信你），不会乱投资，或者有的没的。她拿着钱，会乱花（容易被小红书的姐妹忽悠），我拿钱，就是存着，只做最基本的理财收益。 她拿工资的一半给我固定储蓄（固定 4.5K ），一半她自己花销或者干嘛（实际也就是买吃的，穿的）。家里全部东西都是我选购（除了衣服，这个是真的看个人审美）。包括给双方父母添置的电器，吃喝，给娃的任何东西。所以她基本都不用操心，我都能办好。（我也乐于去办，感觉顺手的事情），所以这也就造成了家里的钱都上交在我这（虽然也没多少）</details></li><li>Many financial books say that people who can&#x27;t even earn a little money are not qualified to manage money.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>好多理财书上都有说这种情况，连一点钱都赚不了的人，是没有资格管钱的。</details></li><li>I didn&#x27;t go skiing, why are there so many 🐢 (referring to people delaying things)<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我也没去滑雪啊，怎么这么多🐢</details></li><li>5k<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>5k</details></li>
