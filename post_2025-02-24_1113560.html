        <h1>Should a novice Android developer give up?</h1>
        <h2>菜鸟 Android 开发该放弃了吗？</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I am an individual developer with a technical stack of Java, Kotlin, and Compose. I did full-time development in 2021, then changed careers. I have continued to follow Android development. My Kotlin and Compose related libraries on GitHub have over a thousand stars. I think I have a decent grasp of the related technologies.

Last year, I got burned after changing careers and was almost ruined, so I'm preparing to come back to development. I looked at Boss Zhipin for a week and only applied for junior positions in Guangdong province, about 30 resumes including some outsourcers who actively asked for my resume. I didn't expect to get a single interview. Is it because the career change/long unemployment period is a big taboo, or is the internet client really that dead?

Should I continue looking for Android work, or change careers? For example, to frontend React/NextJS? I'm a bit more familiar with these two, but I don't have corporate project experience, so I really don't know how to find a job. And after tools like v0 and Cursor mature, will frontend be even more difficult than Android?

Please give me some advice!</p>
            <p>个人开发者，技术栈是 Java 、Kotlin 和 Compose 。21 年做过全职开发，之后就转行了，也有持续关注 Android 开发，GitHub 上 Kotlin 、Compose 相关的库一起大概有一千多的星，自认为相关技术掌握度还可以。

去年转行踩大雷几乎被搞垮准备回来继续做开发，看了一个星期的 Boss 直聘，只投了广东省内初级的，投了快 30 份简历，包括一些外包主动问我要简历的。没想到现在一个面试都没，是转行/空窗期太长犯了大忌还是互联网客户端真的这么凉了吗？

该不该继续找安卓的，还是转行？比如转到前端的 React/NextJS ？个人对这两个比较熟一点，但是没有企业项目经验也属实不知道怎么找，而且 v0 、Cursor 之类的工具成熟之后前端会不会比 Android 更难？

还请各位大佬指点指点！</p>

                <li>Here's my evaluation of HarmonyOS from 2023, which is still valid in 2025. Huawei's phones for the market will continue to maintain a shell-like HarmonyOS system. It's almost impossible for NEXT to enter the market. HarmonyOS has hundreds of millions of users, but it's a shell system mixed with Android. If it's OTA'd to NEXT, Huawei can't solve the old application problem. Millions of Android apps, once upgraded, will be unusable for hundreds of millions of users. Relying on the few apps they sign, without the push of a natural market, the ecosystem can't be supported. Ordinary users seeing Xiaohongshu adapted to HarmonyOS will subconsciously think that all Android functions have been migrated. They might even think that HarmonyOS has optimized the package size very well, but that's impossible. The functions that Android has invested so much manpower into can't be copied all at once. In the end, only a few pages will be adapted. Most of the signed adaptations will eventually be a simplified, fast version of the app for the elderly. And after they adapt, will they continue to iterate normally? I think most of them will be done with version 1.0 and there will be no more updates.<br>贴一下我 23 年对鸿蒙的评价了，如今 2025 依然有效。华为面向市场的手机，会一直维持套壳的 鸿蒙系统，next 几乎很难推向市场.鸿蒙 os 是有大量几亿用户，但这是混合了 Android 的套壳系统，如果 ota 到 NEXT ，华为无法解决老应用的问题，Android 几百万 app ，一升级几亿用户直接没法用.靠着签约那寥寥无几的 app ，没有自然市场的推力是无法支撑生态的普通用户看到小红书适配了鸿蒙，潜意识会觉得迁移了所有的 Android 功能，甚至他们会觉得鸿蒙的包体积优化的很好，实际不可能，android 投入那么多人力做的功能，不可能一下复制出来。最后只会是适配几个页面。大部分签约适配的 最后 会是一个 老人精简极速版 app 。  并且他们适配完，是不是还正常的迭代？我想大部分都是做完 1.0 版本就没有下文了。</li><li>The HarmonyOS market is not as big as imagined. Most companies' HarmonyOS clients just randomly pick a few client colleagues, or directly outsource them. Once the functions are done, that's basically it. There's basically no follow-up maintenance, so it's hard to find a job. Before, I looked for a HarmonyOS job for more than half a month and found that the salary was low, there were few positions, and most of them lasted only three months. Even if they didn't tell you it was for three months, most of them were laid off after a few months. There are too few HarmonyOS development jobs that offer stability.<br>鸿蒙市场远没有想象中那么大。大多数公司的鸿蒙客户端都是随便抽几个客户端同事，或者直接外派出去，功能搞完基本上就没了，基本上没有后续维护，所以也很难有岗位。 之前我找了半个多月的鸿蒙岗位，发现工资又低，岗位又少，而且大多数都是干三个月就没了，就算没有告诉你干三个月的，大多数也是干几个月就被裁了。 那种提供稳定的岗位的鸿蒙开发，太少了。</li><li>Android is now better off going to HarmonyOS, at least you can eat dividends for a few years<br>安卓现在还不如去搞鸿蒙，至少能吃几年红利</li><li>What career did you switch to that caused you to step on a landmine?

It is recommended to learn HarmonyOS, and then develop in the direction of large front-end and AI.<br>只能说很难，是整个客户端，前端都很难。建议学习鸿蒙，之后再往大前端，AI 方向发展</li><li>@july1995 Understood, thank you for providing the information. With this market, it feels like it's even harder for newbies to enter the industry than to find an Android job.<br>@july1995 了解，感谢提供信息，这样的行情感觉小白入行比找安卓还要难</li><li>@TArysiyehua Thank you for the suggestion. It does feel like the client-side is very difficult. Most Android jobs I see are either cross-platform, hardware, or HarmonyOS. I hardly see any Web client-side jobs. If I don't consider going to the bottom layer, maybe only cross-platform and HarmonyOS have some space left.<br>@TArysiyehua 感谢建议，这样说确实感觉客户端都很难了，看到的大多安卓岗位要么跨端要么硬件要么鸿蒙，Web 也几乎没看到招客户端的。不考虑往底层走，可能只有跨端和鸿蒙还有点空间了。</li><li>'Last year, I got burned after changing careers and was almost ruined,' can you elaborate on that?<br>'去年转行踩大雷几乎被搞垮'，方便细说下吗</li><li>Just saw it, how would an individual developer go into farming... I'm lost.<br>刚看到，个人开发者怎么会搞养殖去。。。我丢</li><li>It's hard to find a job now, and it's even harder to find one if you've been unemployed for too long, hahaha.<br>现在找工作，行情不好，空窗期太久的，就更难找了，哈哈哈哈</li><li>@LiuJiang Someone upstairs said, it has nothing to do with computers. But in the future, if someone really wants to enter the farming industry, don't just watch some videos, browse the market, and understand the market before starting. You must find a reliable insider to cooperate with. A newbie making no losses might just be lucky.<br>@LiuJiang 楼上有说，跟计算机没关系，不过以后要是有人真想入行养殖，千万不要自己看点视频逛逛市场了解点行情就开始干，怎么也要找个靠谱的行内人合作，新手做到不赔也可能只是运气好</li><li>@LiuJiang It was still forced. Before AI programming became popular, I could earn some income by taking orders, but after GPT Doubao and the like became popular, even college students' homework is rare.<br>@LiuJiang 还是被逼的，AI 编程火之前自己接单之类还可以有点收入，GPT 豆包之类的火了之后连大学生作业都很少了</li><li>@street000 Don't narrow your path.<br>@street000 别把路走窄了</li><li>@digitalnomad222 That makes sense.

I know a little about the frontend and I'm afraid that I'll be kicked out by those who graduated from big factories if I want to go deeper.<br>@guanhui07 很多人都提到鸿蒙，估计还有空间。还有请问 Web 前端这块看项目经验吗，前端懂点皮毛想深入怕被大厂毕业出来的一脚踢没</li>
