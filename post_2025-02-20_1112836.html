            <p>Hello everyone

I am a complete novice, never ridden a road bike before. Currently, I am only purchasing a bike for commuting and daily rides. The commuting distance is 10 kilometers.
I am currently considering the following two options:

Decathlon RC100:
Advantages: Simple and elegant appearance, relatively affordable price (approximately 1799 yuan), suitable for beginners.
Concerns: There is no Decathlon store locally, worried about inconvenient maintenance and debugging.

Xidesheng AD350:
Advantages: Fashionable design, promotional price is about 3200 yuan, the budget can barely be accepted.
Concerns: I have seen online that the popular model XDS is a pain to repair. Is it really that bad?

Considering my specific situation - there are Giant and Xidesheng stores around my residence, but no Decathlon store - I would like to get everyone&#x27;s opinion, especially those with similar experiences or in-depth understanding of these two brands. Please ask:

Given my limited budget, which option do you think is more suitable for me, or do you have better recommendations? Thank you 🙏</p>

                <p>诸位道友钧鉴：

鄙人初涉骑行之道，往昔未曾驭风而行。今欲购一灵驹，以代步通勤，亦可闲暇漫游，路途约十里。

现已略窥二兽之形：

迪卡侬 RC100：
其形简朴大气，价亦亲民（约一千七百九十九元），适宜初学者入门。
然虑于本地无迪卡侬门庭，恐日后维护调试多有不便。

喜德盛 AD350：
其型时尚新颖，促销之价约三千二百元，勉可承受。
然闻于坊间，此网红款XDS，多有维修之苦，果真如此不堪耶？

顾及鄙人之境况，居所四周有捷安特与喜德盛之所，而无迪卡侬之驻，故欲求诸位之高见，尤望有经验者或对此二牌有所深解之士指点迷津。敢问：

于预算有限之境，诸位以为何者更宜于我？抑或有更胜一筹之荐？拜谢！🙏</p>

                <li>I commute 10km each way and have been cycling to and from work for more than 2 years. The route is mainly urban, but there is always a section of bad road under construction. I tried my friend&#x27;s road bike, although the theoretical speed is fast, there are traffic lights and potholes that often appear, so I can&#x27;t speed up at all, and I also have to worry about the bike being damaged. Later, I decided to get a flat-bar road Giant escape 1, a very comprehensive car, suitable for commuting. Install a rear shelf to put bags and luggage, so you don’t have to carry a backpack and get sweaty. Please refer to it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾亦单程十里通勤，已骑行上下两年有余。途经闹市，然常遇修缮之路。曾试友之公路车，虽云速疾，然红绿灯与坑洼之处频现，实难提速，且虑车体受损。后择捷安特平把公路，此车兼顾，适宜通勤。置后架以承载行囊，免负重而汗流浃背。道友可酌之。</details></li><li>Personal commuting record: Small electric scooter-&gt;mountain bike-&gt;flat-bar road bike-&gt;drop-bar road bike-&gt;flat-bar road bike-&gt;small electric scooter. If you just want to commute and play easily, a flat-bar road bike is the most comfortable.

Road bikes are prone to punctures.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>路面几何？公路车易破胎。</details></li><li>Recommend RC100. The comprehensive frame is more comfortable to ride. The AD350 is an aerodynamic frame, and the geometry is a bit aggressive compared to the comprehensive one. Also, if you have a budget of 3K, you can check out the new VOOK ONE.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>荐 RC100，综合车架骑乘较为舒适。AD350乃具气动之架，几何较之综合稍显激进。若有三千余金，亦可观新出之VOOK ONE。</details></li><li>10km, it seems that people who don’t exercise often need more than 30 minutes to ride a bicycle. If you commute by bike every day, it’s a little tiring. It’s okay if you’re young, but it’s torture for older people. I gave up, and the little electric scooter runs every day, so I’m terribly fat 😮‍💨<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>十里之途，若不常锻炼者，恐需半个时辰以上。若日日骑行通勤，稍感疲惫。年少尚可忍受，年长则如煎熬。吾已弃之，电驴日日奔驰，以致肥胖😮‍💨。</details></li><li>I bought a used ad350 last year. I have ridden it for hundreds of kilometers and have had no problems except for occasional abnormal noises. Of course, I have never ridden any other car.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾去年购入二手AD350，骑行数百里，除偶有异响，未见他恙。然吾亦未曾驾驭他车。</details></li><li>The recommendation is to buy what car shop is nearby. Just for commuting, don&#x27;t buy Xidesheng&#x27;s AD or RS series. Take a look at the flat-bar road bikes in the Jisu series. They are more comfortable to ride.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>荐于近邻之车行购驹。仅为通勤，勿购喜德盛之AD或RS系列，可观极速系列之平把公路车，骑乘更为适宜。</details></li><li>Raise the budget to Stella.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>擢升预算至斯特拉。</details></li><li>I bought an ad350 and haven&#x27;t encountered any problems.

Flat bars fully meet commuting and handling needs. I think there is no point in a road bike that can only run on roads. Even an electric chicken will overtake you. Bicycles should be used to walk on unpaved roads, and even roads where you have to carry the car are where they can show their advantages.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>新手不宜骑弯把车，平把足矣通勤操控。徒以行公路之公路车毫无意义，电鸡可轻超之。自行车当用于非铺装路面, 甚至需扛车而行, 方显其优势。</details></li><li>If you haven&#x27;t ridden a bike much before, it is recommended to first get a cheap mountain bike to get a feel for it. It is not very safe to get a road bike right away.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>若此前鲜有骑行，宜先购廉价山地车以寻手感。骤用公路车，恐不安全。</details></li><li>@LuxChen Thank you I personally feel that flat bars are a little ugly haha<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@LuxChen 感谢 个人感觉平把稍显逊色哈哈</details></li>
