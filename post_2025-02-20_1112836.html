        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello everyone,

I am a complete novice and have never ridden a road bike before. I am currently buying a bike for commuting and daily riding. The commute distance is 10 kilometers.
I am currently considering the following two options:

Decathlon RC100:
Advantages: Simple and elegant appearance, relatively affordable price (about 1799 yuan), suitable for beginners.
Concerns: There is no Decathlon store locally, and I am worried about the inconvenience of future maintenance and debugging.

Xidesheng AD350:
Advantages: Stylish design, the event price is about 3200 yuan, and the budget is barely acceptable.
Concerns: After reading a circle online, everyone said that the popular model xds is easy to repair. Is it really that bad?

Considering my specific situation - there are Giant and Xidesheng stores around my residence, but no Decathlon store - I hope to get everyone&#x27;s opinions, especially those friends who have similar experiences or have in-depth knowledge of these two brands. May I ask:

With a limited budget, which option do you think is more suitable for me or do you have any better recommendations? Thank you 🙏</p>

                <p>各位大佬

我是一个完全的新手，以前从未骑过公路车，目前购车只是为了通勤代步，日常骑行逛逛，通勤距离 10 公里。
我目前考虑了以下两个选项：

迪卡侬 RC100：
优点：外观简洁大方，价格相对亲民（约 1799 元），适合初学者入门。
担忧：本地没有迪卡侬门店，担心后续维护和调试不便。

喜德盛 AD350：
优点：设计时尚，活动价约为 3200 元，预算勉强可以接受。
担忧：网上看了一圈都说是网红款 xds 是修的爽，真的有这么不堪嘛?

考虑到我的具体情况——居住地周围有捷安特和喜德盛门店，但无迪卡侬门店——我希望得到大家的意见，特别是那些有类似经历或对这两个品牌有深入了解的朋友。请问：

在预算有限的情况下，您认为哪一个选择更适合我或者有更好的推荐？谢谢🙏</p>

                <li>I commute 10km one way and have been cycling to and from work for more than 2 years. The daily commute route is mainly urban, but there is always a section of bad road under construction on the route. I tried my friend&#x27;s road bike. Although the theoretical speed is fast, the traffic lights and frequent potholes on the road make it impossible to speed up. At the same time, I have to worry about the car being damaged. Later, I decided to buy a flat-bar road Giant Escape 1, a very comprehensive car, suitable for commuting. Install a rear rack to put bags and pull things, so you don&#x27;t have to carry a bag and get sweaty.楼主 reference it<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我就是单程 10km 通勤，已经骑车上下班 2 年多了，每天上下班路线以城市路线为主，但路线上总有一段是正在修的烂路。尝试过朋友的公路车，虽然理论速度快，但是一路有红绿灯和时常出现的坑洼路段根本也提不起速，同时还得担心车别受损。后来还是决定入了平把公路捷安特 escape 1 ，很综合的车，适合通勤。装个后货架放包拉东西，就不用自己背包弄一身汗了。楼主参考一下</details></li><li>Personal cycling commute record: Small electric donkey -&gt; mountain bike -&gt; flat-bar road bike -&gt; drop-bar road bike -&gt; flat-bar road bike -&gt; If the small electric donkey is just for simple commuting, the flat-bar road bike is the most comfortable, and the drop-bar bike is suitable for exercise<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>个人骑车通勤记录：小电驴-&gt;山地车-&gt;平把公路车-&gt;弯把公路车-&gt;平把公路车-&gt;小电驴只是简单通勤玩玩的话，平把公路车是最舒服的，弯把车适合用来锻炼</details></li><li>Don&#x27;t buy a commuting car that is too good, otherwise it would be a pity if it is lost<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>通勤车别买的太好的，要不然丢了可惜</details></li><li>Is the road surface good?

AD350 is an aerodynamic frame, and the geometry is a bit more aggressive than the integrated frame. In addition, if you have a budget of 3K, you can take a look at the new VOOK ONE car<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>推荐 RC100 ，综合车架骑起来比较舒适，AD350 是气动车架，几何相比综合是有点激进的，另外如果有 3K 的预算可以看看新的 VOOK ONE 这辆车</details></li><li>10km, it seems that it may take more than 30 minutes for people who don&#x27;t exercise often. If you commute by bike every day, it’s okay if you’re a little tired when you’re young, but it’s torture when you’re older. I have given up now. The small electric donkey runs every day, so now I&#x27;m terribly fat. 😮‍💨<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>10km 啊，这个距离貌似自行车可能不经常锻炼的人需要 30 分钟以上，如果天天通勤骑行，有一点点累年轻的话还好说年纪大点简直是煎熬➕折磨我现在放弃了，小电驴每天嘟嘟嘟的跑，所以现在肥的要命唉😮‍💨</details></li><li>I bought a second-hand ad350 last year. I have ridden hundreds of kilometers and there have been no problems except for occasional abnormal noises. Of course, I have never ridden other cars.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我去年买了二手的 ad350 ，骑了几百公里除了偶尔有点异响之外没有别的问题，，当然我也没骑过别的车</details></li><li>It is recommended to buy whatever car store is nearby. If you are just commuting, don&#x27;t buy Xidesheng&#x27;s AD or RS series. Take a look at the flat-bar road bikes in the speed series. They will be more comfortable to ride.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>推荐是附近有什么车店买什么车，只是通勤不要买喜德盛的 AD 或者 RS 系列了，看看极速系列的平把公路车，骑起来会比较舒适</details></li><li>Raise your budget for Stella<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>提点预算上斯特拉</details></li><li>I bought the ad350 and didn&#x27;t encounter any problems.

Flat bars completely meet commuting and handling needs. I don’t think it makes any sense to have a road bike that can only run on roads. Any electric scooter will overtake you. Bicycles should be used to travel on unpaved roads, and even roads that require carrying the bike are where their advantages lie.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>新手不建议骑弯把车，平把完全满足通勤和操控。我觉得只可以跑公路的公路车一点意义没有，随便一台电鸡就把你超了。自行车应该用来走些非铺装路面，甚至要抗车的路才是发挥优势的地方。</details></li><li>If you haven&#x27;t ridden a bike much before, it&#x27;s recommended to get a cheap mountain bike to get a feel for it. It&#x27;s not very safe to get on a road bike right away.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>如果之前没怎么骑过车的话，建议先整个便宜点的山地骑一骑找找手感，上来就公路车不是很安全</details></li><li>@LuxChen Thank you. I personally think flat bars are a bit ugly haha.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@LuxChen 谢谢 个人感觉平把有点丑 哈哈</details></li>
