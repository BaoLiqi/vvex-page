            <p># Labor Arbitration Experience

After more than half a year, it finally came to an end. Although the process was quite tortuous, the final result was still satisfactory. Here, I would like to sincerely thank everyone on V2EX who has helped me. Thank you all for your advice back then. I also thank V2EX for giving me the meaning of sharing. The following are some of my experiences, and I hope they can be helpful to everyone.

## July 28, 2024: Preparing for Labor Arbitration

After unsuccessful communication with the company, I prepared for labor arbitration. At that time, as a newcomer to the workplace, I didn&#x27;t even know what the specific details of the five insurances and one housing fund were, let alone labor arbitration. So I started seeking help from all parties. Fortunately, with the help of V2EX users, I followed the advice and applied for assistance from a lawyer at the legal aid center. Later, I also supplemented and collected evidence as suggested.

### About applying for a lawyer:
You must have agricultural household registration and need to obtain a certificate of agricultural household registration nature, which can be issued by the local town police station.

## August 1, 2024: Signing an Agreement and Submitting an Arbitration Application

After signing the agreement and power of attorney with the legal aid center, I started to connect with the lawyer. On August 3, I submitted the labor arbitration application to the arbitration commission. I filed the lawsuit with the arbitration commission under the jurisdiction of my work location, and I could also file a lawsuit with the arbitration commission at the company&#x27;s registered location (the subsequent trouble lies in this area). A week later, I received a notice of trial, tentatively scheduled for mid-August. During this period, I discussed the details with the lawyer and prepared a statement of defense.

### August 14: First Hearing

On the day of the hearing, none of the relevant personnel of the company showed up, so I could only submit evidence unilaterally. The judge asked me to provide proof that I worked in Xicheng. At that time, I only had the DingTalk attendance records, which were saved as screenshots. The judge did not approve of it and asked me to show the &quot;original carrier&quot; of the evidence. However, the company kicked me out of the DingTalk group chat three days after notifying me, so there was no enterprise certification on DingTalk, and the judge did not approve the evidence.

**Suggestion**: Be sure to keep relevant evidence in a timely manner. It is best to use video recording software with watermarks to keep the evidence in video form.

Later, I showed the judge the chat records of the WeChat work group. WeChat also did not have enterprise certification and could not prove my employment relationship with the company. Therefore, the judge suggested that we file a lawsuit with the arbitration commission at the company&#x27;s registered location due to the issue of jurisdiction. The lawyer was also a little confused. He brought me a lot of evidence, but the judge did not approve of it. Finally, the judge gave us two choices: submit a lawsuit to the company&#x27;s registered location or wait for the next hearing. After communicating with the lawyer, I chose to wait for the next hearing, because if I re-submitted the lawsuit, I would have to go to another district to re-apply for a lawyer or go by myself.

### Complaint:
When filing the case, a screenshot of the proof of work location is acceptable, but I don’t know why it is not accepted during the hearing.

## September 3, 2024: Second Hearing

After half a month of waiting, the second hearing came. During this period, I and the lawyer kept communicating on how to prove the work location, but coincidentally, the company sent someone over for the second time. The judge asked him if he admitted that I worked in Xicheng, and he answered in the affirmative. In this way, the evidence that had troubled me for half a month was glossed over.

The subsequent process proceeded normally, with both parties presenting evidence to each other. The person sent by the company was my previous leader. I don&#x27;t know if he thought the company would definitely win or what, but he recognized most of the evidence I presented, and he didn&#x27;t even calculate my compensation amount before approving it. But later, when it came time for him to present evidence, he was dumbfounded. I did not approve of most of his evidence. On the key evidence, the &quot;Termination of Labor Contract Notice&quot;, the company failed to provide strong evidence to prove my fault. Instead, he presented evidence to the judge on some irrelevant aspects, such as: not participating in company training, not obeying management, and frequently asking for leave (attending conference live training on DingTalk during working hours, and using my own time off is also considered asking for leave? What is the reason for management in an employment relationship?). The judge denied his evidence without asking me if I admitted it. Because the company did not attend the first hearing, it was not allowed to submit additional evidence for the second time. Later, the judge even said sarcastically: If you really recognized this evidence, why didn&#x27;t you write it in the termination notice at that time? The rest was the usual procedure, and the judge persuaded both sides to mediate. Unexpectedly, the company chose not to mediate.

## October 14, 2024: The Ruling Comes Down

After a month and a half, the ruling finally came down. When I received the ruling, I really felt like the hard days were over. In the end, it was ruled as a final ruling, with 2N compensation. Since the amount was not large, the ruling was a final ruling, and the company could no longer appeal, but it could apply to the intermediate court to revoke the ruling. I was also very happy and sent a pennant to the lawyer. I thought I would get the money smoothly, but the company kept dragging it on...

## December 18, 2024: Applying for Compulsory Enforcement

After waiting for 45 days, the company did not apply to the intermediate court to revoke the ruling, nor did it compensate me. So I prepared to apply for compulsory enforcement. Fortunately, compulsory enforcement can be done online, without having to run around offline, which is relatively convenient. The process of compulsory enforcement is like going through labor arbitration again. You have to make various phone calls to consult and submit materials, etc. After several rejections, the case was successfully filed online on December 18, 2024. I feel that this process is quite torturous, because even if you win the labor arbitration, it does not mean that you can really get the money. I don’t know if the waiting process is meaningful. During this period, my father called. I didn&#x27;t want to tell them at first, but the truth cannot be concealed forever. My father is a farmer and has more traditional ideas. He still lives in the era when officials are the most important (it doesn&#x27;t seem wrong to say that now). He scolded me for why I didn’t do a good job and had to sue people and fight the company. How could we possibly win against them? Due to repeated delays, I also began to wonder if I could really get the money, was it really right to do this, and was it meaningful.

## January 3, 2025: Successful Enforcement, Received Compensation

I didn&#x27;t have any ideas about finding a job at the time, and even had a certain resistance to work. Later, when I communicated with many classmates, I found that they had also been laid off. We, as fresh graduates, were not having a good time. The classmates said that the country would solve the employment problem and would give subsidies to companies that hired fresh graduates. The company would try to &quot;remove&quot; our fresh graduate status. In this way, with the idea of ​​lying down at home rather than being internally conflicted outside, I returned home before the New Year. After returning home, I felt much happier, and good news followed. After communicating with the enforcement judge several times, he decided to carry out enforcement on-site on January 3. Fortunately, I provided the judge with several accurate phone numbers, and the enforcement process went smoothly (it is recommended that you keep relevant personnel information as soon as possible and make plans early). I got the money very smoothly a few days ago. The matter is also coming to an end. Currently, I am learning while looking for a job, learning more technical stacks, enriching my skills, and hoping to find a satisfactory job soon. I also wish you all the best and have a good future!</p>

                <p># 劳动仲裁心路历程

历时大半年，终于告一段落，尽管过程十分曲折，但最终的结果还算令人满意。在这里我要郑重地感谢 V 站上所有帮助过我的人。衷心地感谢各位当初对我的建议。也感谢 V 站这个平台，让我有了分享的意义。以下是我的一些心路历程，希望对大家能有所帮助。

## 2024 年 7 月 28 日：准备劳动仲裁

与公司沟通无果，遂准备劳动仲裁。当时对于初入职场的我来说，五险一金具体是什么都不太清楚，劳动仲裁更是一头雾水，于是开始寻求各方帮助。所幸有了 V 友们的帮助，之后我听从了建议，在法律援助中心申请到了一名律师的帮助，后面也是按照建议补充收集证据等。

### 关于律师的申请：
必须是农业户口，需要开具农业户口性质证明，当地镇上派出所就可以开具。

## 2024 年 8 月 1 日：签订协议，提交仲裁申请

和法援中心签订协议及委托书后，开始和律师对接。8 月 3 日向仲裁委提交了劳动仲裁申请书。我是向我工作所在地的管辖仲裁委提起的诉讼，还可以向公司注册地的仲裁委提起诉讼（后续麻烦的地方也在这块）。一周之后收到了开庭通知，暂定在 8 月中旬。期间和律师商量了一下细节，准备好答辩状。

### 8 月 14 日：第一次开庭

开庭当天，公司相关人员一个也没有到场，所以只能我单方面提交证据。法官要求我出具在西城工作证明，我当时手里只有钉钉的打卡记录，并且是截图方式保存的。法官不认可，要求我出示证据的“原始载体”。但是公司在通知我的三天后就将我踢出钉钉群聊，所以钉钉上就没有企业认证，法官不认可证据。

**建议**：一定要及时保留相关证据，最好用带水印的录视频软件，以视频的方式保留证据。

后来给法官看微信工作群的聊天记录，微信也没有企业认证，证明不了我和公司的雇佣关系。所以法官就管辖权问题建议我们向公司注册地仲裁委提起诉讼。律师也是有点懵，带着我找了一堆证据，法官都不认可。最后法官给了我们两个选择，向公司注册地提交诉讼或是等待下一次开庭。我和律师沟通了一下之后选择等待下一次开庭，因为我如果重新提交诉讼，就得去另一个区重新申请律师或者我自己一个人去。

### 吐槽：
立案审核工作地点证明的时候用截图的复印件就可以，不知道为啥开庭的时候却不认可。

## 2024 年 9 月 3 日：第二次开庭

经过半个月的等待，迎来了第二次开庭。期间我和律师一直在沟通如何证明工作地点的问题，但好巧不巧的是公司第二次派人过来了。法官问了他是否承认我在西城工作的事实，他回答承认。就这样困扰了我半个月的证据一笔带过了。

之后的流程正常进行，双方互相举证。公司派过来的人是我之前的领导，也不知道他是觉得公司一定能赢还是咋的，对于我举证的大部分证据都认可，我的赔偿金额计算方式连算都没算就认可了。但是后来到他举证的时候他傻眼了，我对于他大部分的举证都不认可，在关键证据“劳动合同解除通知书”上，公司未能拿出有力证据证明我的过失。反而在一些无关紧要的方面向法官举证我，比如：不参加公司培训、不服管教、经常请假等（上班时间钉钉开会议直播培训，用自己的调休也算请假？雇佣关系何来管教一说呢）。法官都没有问我是否承认就否定了他的证据。因为公司第一次开庭未到，第二次开庭也不允许再次补充提交证据了。后来法官更是杀人诛心地说：如果你真正认可这些证据的话当时为什么没有把这些写到解除通知书里面呢？后面还是常规流程，法官两面劝导调解。出人意料的是公司选择了不调解。
## 2024 年 10 月 14 日：裁决书下来

经过一个半月，裁决书终于下来了。拿到裁决书的时候真是有一种苦日子熬到头了的感觉。最终判了终局裁决，2n 的赔偿。由于金额不大，所以裁决是终局裁决，公司不能再上诉，但可以向中级法院申请撤销裁决。我也很高兴，给律师送去了锦旗。以为会顺利拿到钱，没想到公司却是一拖再拖...

## 2024 年 12 月 18 日：申请强制执行

在经过了 45 天的等待期之后，公司没有向中级法院申请撤销裁决，也没有对我进行赔偿。于是我准备申请强制执行。好在强制执行可以在网上办理，不用在线下跑来跑去了，还是相对方便一些。强制执行的过程就像又经历了一遍劳动仲裁一样，也得各种打电话咨询，提交材料等等。历经了几次驳回以后，在 2024 年 12 月 18 日网上立案成功。感觉这个过程还是比较折磨的，因为就算劳动仲裁赢了，也不代表能真正拿到钱，等待的过程不知道有没有意义。期间我的父亲来过电话，本来是没想告诉他们的，但纸终究包不住火。我的父亲是个农民，思想比较传统，还停留在那个官就是天的时代（好像放在现在也没什么错）。呵斥我为什么好端端的工作不干要和人打官司，跟公司斗，咱们怎么可能赢得了人家啊。由于一再的等待，我也开始怀疑，我真的能拿到钱吗，这样做真的对吗，有意义吗。

## 2025 年 1 月 3 日：成功执行，拿到赔偿

当时没有任何找工作的想法，甚至对工作产生了一定的抵触心理。后来跟许多同学交流的时候发现他们也被裁了，同为应届生的我们过得都不好。同学说国家要解决就业问题，会给招收应届生的公司补助，公司会想办法把我们的应届生身份给“除掉”。就这样，抱着与其在外面内耗不如回家躺平的想法，在年前回到了家。回家之后心情也开朗了许多，好消息也接踵而至。执行法官和我沟通了几次之后，决定在 1 月 3 日进行上门执行。好在我给法官提供了几个准确的电话号码，执行过程也很顺利（这里建议大家及早保留相关人员信息，早做打算）。前些日子也是很顺利的拿到了钱。事情也算告一段落。目前边学习边找工作，多学一些技术栈，丰富丰富技能，希望能早日找到一个顺心的好工作。也祝愿大家心想事成，都能有一个好的未来！</p>

If you don&#x27;t protect your rights, it&#x27;s useless to rely on others. The cost of litigation in China is already very low.

It has become a law that protects companies in disguise. Ordinary people know that the process is so complicated that it has dissuaded most people. The company is completely unscrupulous and directly asks you to go to arbitration. Even if the judgment is made, it will not give it to you, and you have to go through compulsory enforcement. It takes at least half a year and at most a year and a half to complete this process. I have seen some companies file a lawsuit against you with false evidence after the judgment is made, disgusting you again, and wasting another half a year. However, even if the company loses in the end, there is no punishment, and employees can only get the 2N they deserve. The company has no loss at all.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>所以这个劳动法有何用呢？变相成为保护公司的法条，普通人知道要走这么繁琐的流程，已经劝退大部分人了，公司完全有恃无恐，直接叫你去仲裁，判下来了还不给你，还要走强制执行，这一套流程走下来，少则半年，多则一年半。亲眼看到有的公司还会在判决下来后，反手用假证据起诉你，再恶心你一次，又耗多你半年，然而就算公司最后输了，也没有任何处罚，员工只能拿到应得的 2n ，公司完全没有什么损失。</details></li><li>Congratulations! I remember once taking a taxi with a colleague. The driver was chatting and talked about his own lawsuits. He said that he had fought many lawsuits and mentioned it briefly. After getting out of the car, my colleague told me that he didn&#x27;t like people who often filed lawsuits. But I want to say that you must protect your rights, and filing a lawsuit is the most legitimate thing to do. Also, when I was renting a house later, I searched for the problem of subletting. At that time, subletting in Beijing was particularly rampant. I even encountered a situation where the original tenant was still there when I was looking at the house and secretly told me that this subletter was not good and not to rent it. But some people have also been cheated by subletters and filed lawsuits to get their money back. Never be afraid of trouble, never be afraid that filing a lawsuit is bad, you should file a lawsuit when you should. This is for protecting your rights and reducing unhealthy tendencies in the entire society. Even if the law is unreasonable, it is possible to amend the law if the matter is big. If you admit everything, you will really lose everything.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>恭喜！  想起来当年有一次和同事一起打车，司机侃大山，聊起来自己打官司，他说自己打过多次官司，稍微说了下。下车后，同事和我说他不喜欢这种老打官司的人。但是要我说啊，自己的权益就是要维护，打官司再正当不过了。还有后来租房的时候，搜了一下二房东的问题，当时北京二房东特别猖獗，我甚至遇到一次看房的时候原租户还在，偷偷和我这个二房东不行别租。但是也有人被二房东坑了打官司要回钱。  千万被怕麻烦，千万别怕打官司不好，该打就得打，这样对自己来说是维护了权益，对整个社会来说也是减少不正之风。即使法律不合理，闹大了也有修改法律的可能。什么都认那就是真的都没了。</details></li><li>@Jammmm Yes, I recommend multiple forms of preservation of evidence, backup saving, etc. DingTalk, a software designed for enterprises, will not be on the side of ordinary people like us. After being kicked out of DingTalk, all your attendance records, salary slips, chat records, enterprise certification, etc. will disappear. Therefore, I suggest keeping the evidence as early as possible, using multiple forms to keep the evidence, and using multiple devices to keep the evidence.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Jammmm 是的，对于证据的保存我推荐多种形式，备份保存等。钉钉这种为企业设计的软件是不会向着我们普通人的，被踢出钉钉之后你的所有打卡记录，工资条流水，聊天记录，企业认证等都会消失。所以我建议及早保留证据，采用多种形式保留证据，使用多个设备保留证据。</details></li><li>@unco020511 It is stipulated by law that illegal dismissal is 2N. That is to say, the company should have compensated 2N in the first place. The poster worked hard to file a lawsuit, but the company didn&#x27;t give the money after the ruling. In the end, the poster had to go through compulsory enforcement, and the company only compensated the 2N stipulated by law in the end.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@unco020511 这是法律规定非法辞退是 2N ，就是说公司本来就该赔 2N 。贴主辛苦打官司，裁决下来公司也不给钱，最后贴主还得折腾强制执行，公司最终也只赔了法律规定的 2N</details></li><li>That&#x27;s how it is in China. Salary disputes and labor contract disputes are not complicated. You don&#x27;t even need the assistance of a lawyer if you understand it yourself. It&#x27;s just that compulsory enforcement is very difficult in the end. In LZ&#x27;s case, the judge helped with the on-site enforcement. In many actual cases, the boss is just put on the list of &quot;debt defaulters&quot; and restricted from high consumption, etc. The environment is still too friendly to debt defaulters, especially in China, where various bank cards are subject to risk control and card lock. It&#x27;s too difficult for ordinary people to provide evidence of how debt defaulters transfer assets.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>国内就是这样，讨薪的劳动合同纠纷案件并不复杂，甚至自己了解下都不需要律师协助，只是最后强制执行很有难度，LZ 这个案例是有法官帮上门执行的，实际挺多案例只是老板给列入“老赖”名单，限制高消费之类的。环境对老赖还是太友好了，尤其是国内各种银行卡动不动就风控锁卡的情况下，老赖怎么转移资产的还要普通人去举证，太难了</details></li><li>@Jasmine2016 If it is convenient, I suggest you keep them all. After all, it is not very convenient to ask for them after leaving the job. The phone numbers I gave the judge were those of the chairman of the company and the leader of the branch. Also, you can go to the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System to check the shareholders of the company. See if you can find their phone numbers within the company through their names. In short, finding the boss&#x27;s phone number should be enough.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Jasmine2016 如果方便的话我建议你都留着，毕竟离职之后再要的话不是很方便。我给法官的是公司董事长和分公司的领导的电话。再一个你可以去国家企业信用信息公示系统，查一下公司的股东们。通过他们的姓名，看看能不能在公司内部找到他们的电话。总之找到公司的老板电话应该就可以</details></li><li>Congratulations OP, thank you for providing experience for the victims.
