            <p># Labor Arbitration Experience

After more than half a year, it finally came to an end. Although the process was very tortuous, the final result was satisfactory. Here, I would like to sincerely thank everyone on V2EX who has helped me. Thank you all for your advice. I also thank V2EX for giving me the meaning of sharing. The following are some of my experiences, hoping to help everyone.

## July 28, 2024: Preparing for labor arbitration

Failed to communicate with the company, so I prepared for labor arbitration. At that time, as a newcomer to the workplace, I didn&#x27;t know what the five insurances and one housing fund were, and labor arbitration was even more confusing. So I began to seek help from all sides. Fortunately, with the help of V2EX users, I followed the advice and applied for the help of a lawyer at the legal aid center. Later, I also supplemented and collected evidence according to the advice.

### About the application for a lawyer:
You must have an agricultural household registration. You need to issue a certificate of agricultural household registration nature, which can be issued by the local town police station.

## August 1, 2024: Sign the agreement and submit the arbitration application

After signing the agreement and power of attorney with the legal aid center, I started to connect with the lawyer. On August 3, I submitted the labor arbitration application to the arbitration commission. I filed the lawsuit with the arbitration commission under the jurisdiction of my work place. I can also file a lawsuit with the arbitration commission at the company&#x27;s registered address (the trouble later also lies in this area). A week later, I received a hearing notice, tentatively scheduled for mid-August. During the period, I discussed the details with the lawyer and prepared the defense.

### August 14: First hearing

On the day of the hearing, none of the relevant personnel of the company were present, so I could only submit evidence unilaterally. The judge asked me to produce a work certificate in Xicheng. At that time, I only had the DingTalk attendance record, and it was saved as a screenshot. The judge did not approve of it, and asked me to show the &quot;original carrier&quot; of the evidence. However, the company kicked me out of the DingTalk group chat three days after notifying me, so there was no enterprise authentication on DingTalk, and the judge did not approve of the evidence.

**Suggestion**: Be sure to keep relevant evidence in time, and it is best to keep the evidence in the form of video with a watermarked video recording software.

Later, I showed the judge the chat history of the WeChat work group. WeChat also did not have enterprise authentication, which could not prove my employment relationship with the company. So the judge suggested that we file a lawsuit with the arbitration commission at the company&#x27;s registered address on the issue of jurisdiction. The lawyer was also a little confused, and took me to find a lot of evidence, but the judge did not approve of it. Finally, the judge gave us two choices: submit a lawsuit to the company&#x27;s registered address or wait for the next hearing. I communicated with the lawyer and chose to wait for the next hearing, because if I resubmit the lawsuit, I would have to go to another district to re-apply for a lawyer or go by myself.

### Complaint:
When the case was filed, a photocopy of the work location certificate with a screenshot was acceptable, but I don&#x27;t know why it was not accepted during the hearing.

## September 3, 2024: Second hearing

After half a month of waiting, the second hearing came. During the period, the lawyer and I had been communicating on how to prove the work location, but coincidentally, the company sent someone over for the second time. The judge asked him if he admitted that I worked in Xicheng, and he answered yes. In this way, the evidence that had troubled me for half a month was skipped.

The subsequent process proceeded normally, and both parties presented evidence to each other. The person sent by the company was my previous leader. I don&#x27;t know if he thought that the company would definitely win or what, but he recognized most of the evidence I presented. He recognized my calculation method for compensation without even calculating it. But when it came time for him to present evidence, he was dumbfounded. I did not recognize most of his evidence. On the key evidence, the &quot;Termination of Labor Contract Notice&quot;, the company failed to produce strong evidence to prove my fault. Instead, they presented evidence to the judge on some unimportant aspects, such as: not participating in company training, disobeying management, frequent requests for leave, etc. (The training was broadcast live during the meeting during working hours, and using my own time off was also considered a leave? What kind of management can there be in an employment relationship?). The judge denied his evidence without asking me whether I admitted it. Because the company did not attend the first hearing, it was not allowed to submit additional evidence at the second hearing. Later, the judge even said cruelly: If you really recognize this evidence, why didn&#x27;t you write these in the termination notice at that time? The subsequent process was still the regular process, and the judge advised both sides to mediate. Unexpectedly, the company chose not to mediate.
## October 14, 2024: Ruling down

After a month and a half, the ruling finally came down. When I received the ruling, I really felt like the hard days were over. The final judgment was a final ruling, 2n compensation. Because the amount was not large, the ruling was a final ruling, and the company could no longer appeal, but could apply to the intermediate court for revocation of the ruling. I was also very happy and sent a banner to the lawyer. I thought I would get the money smoothly, but the company dragged on and on...

## December 18, 2024: Apply for enforcement

After a 45-day waiting period, the company did not apply to the intermediate court for revocation of the ruling, nor did it compensate me. So I prepared to apply for enforcement. Fortunately, enforcement can be handled online, so you don&#x27;t have to run around offline, which is relatively convenient. The process of enforcement is like going through labor arbitration again. You have to call for consultation and submit materials, etc. After several rejections, the case was successfully filed online on December 18, 2024. I feel that this process is still relatively torturous, because even if you win the labor arbitration, it does not mean that you can really get the money. I don&#x27;t know if the waiting process is meaningful. During the period, my father called. I didn&#x27;t want to tell them, but the paper couldn&#x27;t hold the fire after all. My father is a farmer with traditional ideas, still stuck in the era when officials were the days (it seems that there is nothing wrong with it now). He scolded me for why I didn&#x27;t do a good job and had to sue people and fight with the company. How could we possibly win against them. Due to repeated waiting, I also began to wonder, can I really get the money, is it really right to do this, is it meaningful.

## January 3, 2025: Successful enforcement, get compensation

At that time, I had no idea of finding a job, and even had a certain resistance to work. Later, when I communicated with many classmates, I found that they were also laid off. As recent graduates, we were not doing well. The classmates said that the country would solve the employment problem and would give subsidies to companies that hire recent graduates. The company would try to &quot;remove&quot; our status as recent graduates. In this way, with the idea of ​​lying down at home rather than consuming internally outside, I returned home before the New Year. After returning home, I felt much better, and good news followed. After communicating with the enforcement judge several times, he decided to conduct on-site enforcement on January 3. Fortunately, I provided the judge with several accurate phone numbers, and the enforcement process was also very smooth (here I suggest that you keep relevant personnel information as early as possible and plan ahead). I got the money smoothly a few days ago. The matter is also considered to be over. I am currently studying and looking for a job, learning more technical stacks, and enriching my skills. I hope to find a satisfactory job soon. I also wish you all the best and have a good future!</p>

                <p>忆昔仲裁路，步履维艰，几经寒暑，终有所获。虽道途崎岖，荆棘丛生，然玉汝于成，得偿所愿。铭感V站诸友襄助，解惑释疑，实乃雪中送炭之举。V站 Plattform，使我有所得，欲报涌泉，遂书此篇，以飨同道。望阅者有所裨益，避我之覆辙。

## 岁在甲辰，七月廿八： 仲裁备战

公司颟顸，沟通未果，遂决意仲裁。初入职场，五险一金懵懂无知，仲裁更是雾里看花。幸得V友指点迷津，茅塞顿开，遂往法律援助 Center，求得律师襄助，依计蒐集证据，以备后用。

### 律师之申请：
须持农籍，开具户籍性质之证明，往当地派出所可得。

## 八月一日： 盟约既定，呈递仲裁申请

与法援 Center 签订盟约委托书后，遂与律师接洽。八月初三，向仲裁委递交仲裁申请书。吾向工作之地仲裁委提起诉讼，亦可向公司注册之地仲裁委提起诉讼（后患亦在此）。一周后，得开庭之通知，暂定八月中旬。其间与律师商榷细节，撰写答辩状。

### 八月十四： 庭辩初试

开庭之日，公司诸人未至，吾唯有单方呈递证据。法官责令吾出具于西城工作之佐证。吾时仅有钉钉打卡记录，且以截图存之。法官不允，责令吾示证据之“原始载体”。然公司于示吾三日后，逐吾于钉钉群，故钉钉之上无企业认证，法官仍不认可。

**谏言**：务必及时保留相关证据，以带水印之录像软件摄录为佳，以为佐证。

后吾向法官展示微信工作群之聊天记录，微信亦无企业认证，无法佐证吾与公司之 Incarnation关系。故而法官以管辖权事，建议吾等向公司注册地仲裁委提起诉讼。律师亦愕然，携吾奔走寻觅证据，然法官皆不认可。终法官予吾等二择：向公司注册地呈递诉讼，或静待下一次开庭。吾与律师商榷后，决议静待下一次开庭，盖因吾若重递诉讼，则须至另一区重申律师，或只身前往。

### 吐槽：
立案审核工作地点佐证之时，截图复印件尚可，不知何故开庭之时却不认可。

## 九月三日： 二度庭辩

经半月静待，迎来二度开庭。其间吾与律师殚精竭虑，思忖如何佐证工作地点之事，然天不佑我，公司二度遣人至。法官问之是否承认吾于西城工作之事实，其应允。如是，困扰吾半月之证据一笔带过。

其后流程如常，双方互呈证据。公司所遣乃吾先前之领导，不知其是笃信战必胜，抑或何故，于吾所举之证据多予认可，吾索赔额度之计算方式连算皆未算便予以认可。然待其呈递证据之时，其愕然。吾对于其所呈递之证据多不认可。于关键证据“劳动合同解除通知书”之上，公司未能出具强有力之证据佐证吾之过失。反于无关紧要之方面向法官举证吾，例如：不参与公司学习，不服管教，屡请休假等（上班时间钉钉开会议直播学习，用己之调休亦算请假？Incarnation关系，何来管教一说）。法官未问吾是否承认便予以否定其证据。盖因公司初次开庭阙席，二度开庭亦不允再次补充呈递证据。后法官更是诛心之语：若尔果真认可此等证据，当时为何不将此等书于解除通知书之内？后仍是寻常流程，法官两面劝导调解。出人意料的是公司选择了不调解。
## 十月十四： 裁决书下

经一月有半，裁决书终下。得裁决书之时，真乃苦尽甘来之感。终判决终局裁决，2n之赔偿。因数额不大，故裁决为终局裁决，公司不可再上诉，然可向中级法院申请撤销裁决。吾亦欣喜万分，予律师送以锦旗。以为可顺利得财，未料公司一拖再拖...

## 十二月十八： 申请强制执行

经四十五日之静待，公司未向中级法院申请撤销裁决，亦未对吾予以赔偿。于是吾准备申请强制执行。幸甚强制执行可在网上办理，省却奔波之苦。强制执行之过程恍若再历一遍仲裁，亦须各种电话咨询、提交材料等。历经数次驳回之后，于甲辰年腊月十八网上立案成功。感此过程颇为折磨，盖因纵使仲裁获胜，亦不意味着可真得财，静待之过程不知是否有所意义。其间吾父来电，本不欲告之，然纸终究包不住火。吾父乃农人，思想传统，仍停留在官本位之时代。呵斥吾为何好端端之工作不干，要与人打官司，与公司斗，又怎能战胜之乎。因一再静待，吾亦始生疑窦，吾真可得财否，此举果真正确，果真有所裨益乎。

## 岁在乙巳，元月三日： 成功执行，得偿所愿

当时吾无任何寻职之想法，甚对工作有所抵触。后与诸多同窗交流之时，方知彼等亦被裁，同为应届生之吾等境遇皆不佳。同窗言及国家欲解决就业问题，将予招收应届生之公司补贴，公司或将设法将吾等应届生之身份“除掉”。如是，吾抱与其于外耗费心神，不如归家躺平之想法，于年前返家。返家之后心境亦开朗许多，喜讯亦接踵而至。执行法官与吾沟通数次之后，决议于元月三日进行上门执行。幸吾予法官提供数个准确之电话号码，执行过程亦甚顺利（此处建议诸位及早保留相关人员信息，早作打算）。前些日子亦甚顺利地得到赔偿。此事亦算告一段落。目前边学习边寻职，多掌握一些技术栈，丰富丰富技能，冀望早日寻得一顺心之好工作。亦祝愿诸位心想事成，皆可有美好之未来！</p>

It has become a law that protects companies in disguise. Ordinary people know that they have to go through such a cumbersome process, which has already discouraged most people. The company is completely fearless and directly asks you to go to arbitration. Even if the judgment is made, they will not give it to you, and you have to go through compulsory execution. This whole process takes at least half a year, and up to a year and a half. I have seen companies file a lawsuit against you with fake evidence after the judgment is made, disgusting you again, and consuming another half a year. However, even if the company loses in the end, there is no penalty, and employees can only get the 2n they deserve. The company does not suffer any loss.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>是故劳动法有何用？变相为庇护公司之律条，常人知须历此烦琐流程，早已劝退大半。公司全然无惧，径令汝往仲裁。纵使判决既下，亦不予汝，尚须强制执行。此等流程走完，短则半年，长则一年半。亲见有公司于判决既下后，反手以伪证起诉汝，再恶心汝一次，又耗汝半年。然纵使公司最终败诉，亦无任何处罚，员工唯得应得之2n，公司并无丝毫损失。</details></li><li>Congratulations! I remembered that once I took a taxi with a colleague, and the driver chatted侃大山, talking about his own lawsuits. He said that he had fought many lawsuits and said a little bit. After getting out of the car, my colleague told me that he didn&#x27;t like people who often go to lawsuits like this. But I want to say that you have to protect your rights, and suing is the right thing to do. Also, when I was renting a house later, I searched for the problems of second landlords. At that time, second landlords in Beijing were particularly rampant. I even encountered a situation where the original tenant was still there when I was looking at a house, secretly telling me that this second landlord would not rent. But some people were cheated by second landlords and sued to get their money back. Don&#x27;t be afraid of trouble, don&#x27;t be afraid of suing. You have to sue if you have to. This is to protect your rights and reduce unjust practices in the whole society. Even if the law is unreasonable, there is a possibility of amending the law if it is a big deal. If you recognize everything, then you really have nothing.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>恭喜道友！忆昔曾与同僚共乘，车夫侃侃而谈，聊及其自身之讼事。其言曾数次兴讼，略述一二。下车后，同僚告吾其不喜此等屡兴讼者。然吾欲言之，己之权益须臾卫护，讼事乃正当之举。又后吾租赁房舍之时，搜索二房东之问题。彼时京师二房东尤为猖獗。吾乃至遇一状况，看房之时原租户尚在，偷偷告吾此二房东不行，勿租。然亦有人被二房东所坑，兴讼索回财物。切莫畏惧麻烦，切莫畏惧讼事不好，该讼则讼，此于己乃卫护权益，于整个社会亦减少不正之风。即便律法不合理，闹大亦有修订律法之可能。若事事认命，则真的一无所有矣。</details></li><li>@Jammmm Yes, I recommend multiple forms of evidence preservation, backup preservation, etc. DingTalk, a software designed for enterprises, will not favor ordinary people like us.

So I suggest keeping evidence as early as possible, keeping evidence in multiple forms, and using multiple devices to keep evidence.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Jammmm 然也，我推荐多种形式之证据保存，如备份保存等。钉钉乃为企业所设计之软件，自不会偏袒吾等常人。遭踢出钉钉之后，尔之所有打卡记录、工资条流水、聊天记录、企业认证等皆将消弭。故吾建议及早保留证据，采用多种形式保留证据，使用多个设备保留证据。</details></li><li>@unco020511 This is legally stipulated that illegal dismissal is 2N, that is to say, the company should have compensated 2N.

Cases of wage arrears and labor contract disputes are not complicated. You don&#x27;t even need a lawyer if you understand it yourself, but compulsory execution is very difficult in the end. In LZ&#x27;s case, the judge helped with on-site execution. In fact, many cases are just that the boss is included in the &quot;dishonest&quot; list, restricting high consumption, etc. The environment is still too friendly to dishonest people, especially in China, where various bank cards are controlled and locked at every turn. It is too difficult for ordinary people to provide evidence of how the dishonest people transfer assets.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>天朝便是如此，讨薪与劳动合同纠纷之案件并不繁杂，甚至己身了解之便无需律师协助，不过最终之强制执行甚具难度。楼主之案例尚有法官助上门执行。实则诸多案例不过老板被列于“老赖”名单，限制高消费云云。环境对于老赖仍是过于友好，尤以天朝各种银行カード动辄遭风控锁カル之状况下，老赖如何转移资产尚須常人举证，何其难也！</details></li><li>@Jasmine2016 If it is convenient, I suggest you keep them all. After all, it is not convenient to ask for them again after leaving the job. I gave the judge the phone numbers of the chairman of the company and the leader of the branch. You can also go to the National Enterprise Credit Information Disclosure System to check the shareholders of the company. Through their names, see if you can find their phone numbers within the company. In short, you should be able to find the phone number of the company&#x27;s boss.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Jasmine2016 若便利，吾建议汝悉数保留。盖因离职之后再索甚不方便。吾予法官公司董事长及分公司领导之电话号码。尔亦可往国家企业信用信息公示系统，察之公司之股东。通过彼等之姓名，观之可否于公司内部寻得彼之电话号码。总而言之，应可寻得公司老板之电话。</details></li><li>Congratulations OP, thank you OP for providing experience for victims.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>恭喜楼主，感楼主予受害者提供经验。</details></li><li>Congratulations! 🎉<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>恭喜！🎉</details></li><li>Congratulations, a model for us!
