            <p>Now there are many families, and most of the savings are basically deposited in the name of one person. It may have been based on unconditional trust when it was agreed at the beginning, but as they get along for a long time, conflicts will inevitably increase a lot. The current divorce rate also shows that it is difficult for couples to have complete trust, after all, so many people say they will leave. At the beginning, two people tied all their wealth to one family, and the other party had to take half of it, and even in many families, one person managed most of the property alone. On the one hand, it is the increasing crisis of trust caused by impetuous marital relationships, and on the other hand, it is the status quo of the other party&#x27;s possession of their property. It&#x27;s like walking a tightrope. Once the other party has different intentions, your property will inevitably suffer huge losses. How to balance this sense of insecurity?</p>

                <li>@gjw8u8 You have been brainwashed very thoroughly. What do you mean by giving you children? Aren&#x27;t children the woman&#x27;s children? How do you know that the woman doesn&#x27;t want a child?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@gjw8u8 汝受蛊惑至深，何谓为汝诞育子女？子女非女子之嗣乎？安知女子不欲子嗣？</details></li><li>We solve this by monthly reconciliation + balance. The first principle is: 1 Financial consumption is completely transparent, and both parties have the right to view each other&#x27;s consumption records and bank statements at any time (but usually they don’t, it’s rare to be confused) 2 Consumption greater than 1000 requires the consent of both parties, and small amounts can be spent directly. 3 Post-marital income is the joint property of the couple, not that you earn more and spend more. 4 Property is kept jointly, and everyone has money in hand. Operational level: 1 Reconcile accounts after each month&#x27;s salary day to get the total family funds, how much male and female have in their hands, calculate the difference and transfer it to the other party, and the amount in the hands of the two people is always equal after completion. Monthly expenses can be obtained by subtracting monthly income from the total assets of two months, so all expenses are borne jointly by the two, which is fair. Everyone has money in hand, which is convenient for spending money at ordinary times. Monthly reconciliation ensures that large monthly expenses can be discovered immediately without hiding anything. Special funds are set up in separate accounts and are not included in the above calculations, such as raising children, buying houses, funds, pre-marital property, etc.# The significance of the balance mode The first principle is: I believe that a family is built by the joint efforts of family members, and everyone has the responsibility to contribute to the family, and at the same time has the right to protect their own Rights. Moreover, from the perspective of equality for all, everyone should have 50% of the rights and obligations. Based on this basic principle, the following inferences can be obtained: Earning money should be divided equally (earn and spend together, whether it is moral or legal, it should be like this) Spending money should each have the same say (couples have equal rights to family property, so they should have the same say) In order to achieve the above goals, balance is a reliable and effective solution: 1 Monthly balance to ensure equal division of income Income is naturally shared, and no one will have the behavior of asking the other party for money every month, which affects self-esteem 2 Monthly balance to ensure that expenses are jointly borne It is the same who pays for it normally The monthly extraordinary amount will be discovered immediately 3 Each person holds 50% of the assets, so at least for economic issues, everyone can ensure that they have equal say Prevent extreme situations where one party messes up Ensure that large expenses must be agreed by both parties # Summary The balance system is to solve the above contradictions. Under this system, it can ensure that family income is always shared, family support is always borne jointly, and everyone is an equal family member with equal rights and mutual respect.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾等以月度对账与平衡解之。其则一：一者，财务消费澄明，双方皆可查对方消费记录及银行流水（然常不查，难得糊涂）。二者，逾千者，需双方允准，小额可径用。三者，婚后所得，乃夫妻共有，非多赚多花。四者，家财共管，人手有余钱。操作层面：每月俸禄日后对账，得家庭总资，男女各持几何，算差额转予对方，成后二人手中金额恒等。月度开销可由双月总资差减当月所得，如是，诸开支皆二人共担，公平允当。人人皆有余钱，平素花销便捷。月度对账保大额花销可立时发觉，无所遁形。至于专项款项另立账户，不参此计算，如养育幼崽、购良宅、基金、婚前财产等。# 平账模式之义首在其则也：吾以为，家者，由家员共同协力筑成，人皆有责为家付出，贡献，同时亦有权庇护自身权益。且，以人人平等观之，人皆应享五成权利与义务。以此为本，可得如下推论：挣钱应平分（一同挣一同花，无论道义抑或律法，皆当如是）花钱应各执相同话语权（夫妻对家财有平等之权利，故理应有相同话语权）为达上目标，平账乃可靠有效之法：一者，月度平账，确保管收平分，岁入自当共享，无每月向一方索钱，损及自尊之举。二者，月度平账，保开用共同承担，平时谁掏钱无异，异常大额每月可立时发觉。三者，人皆持五成资产，则至少于经济事体，可保人皆执等同话语权，防一方 捣乱之极端环境，确保大额开销必经双方应允。# 小结平账之制，乃为解上述矛盾，于此制下，可保家计岁入永世共享，家庭扶持永担共，人人皆乃地位平等互相尊重之家庭成员。</details></li><li>If you don&#x27;t trust each other, you can&#x27;t be husband and wife.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>无信，则难为道侣。</details></li><li>1. Don&#x27;t get married and see through that marriage is a business under the advanced packaging of modern systems. 2. If a deal is made in a muddle, and you find that the loss is huge in the middle, stop the loss in time, admit defeat and leave the market. 3. Endure it. Since you can&#x27;t bear the pain of rational thinking and decision-making, complain without solving it, solicit opinions without implementing it, then continue to endure the pain of the transaction.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>一、莫结连理，看透婚姻乃现世制度华丽袍裹下之交易。二、若糊涂成买卖，途中察觉亏损极大，及时止损，愿赌服输割肉离场。三、忍之。既不堪理性思辨与决断之苦，徒怨而不解，求教而不行，则续忍交易之苦。</details></li><li>@gjw8u8 #8 Xu&#x27;s lawyering value is still rising<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@gjw8u8 #8 徐讼师之价值仍在攀升。</details></li><li>Yan Dongping&#x27;s influence continues<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>燕冬萍之影响力仍在持续。</details></li><li>I, also as a woman, hate parasites who demand that men hand over their wages.

If a woman plans to marry you and have children for you, this is a great commitment and sacrifice. Treat yourself and your other half well.

I am willing to give you money/manage me as the economic basis of the family because I trust you/love you/live with you. 2. I must give you money as a security deposit in exchange for you to trust me/love me/live with me. If it is 1, the relationship between husband and wife will be very harmonious, and such a question will not be raised at all. If it is 2, what does it have to do with who manages the money? It is clearly a matter of emotion and trust.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>今之婚家庭，多因果倒置。一者，吾信汝/爱汝/与汝共白首，故愿将钱财予汝/视吾为家计基础管理。二者，吾必将钱财予汝以为保证金，以换汝信吾/爱吾/与吾共白首。若为一，夫妻关系则甚和谐，此类问题绝不提及。若为二，则与谁掌财有何干系？分明乃情感与信任之题也。</details></li><li>@yinmin Why is it assumed that women can&#x27;t earn more than men?

Regarding public expenditures, Alipay Xiaobao set up a family fund, and each of the two transfers 4,000 yuan into it every month. Rent, mortgage, firewood, rice, oil, etc. are all paid from here. Occasionally, if someone forgets to use the family fund to pay for a meal, neither party cares. For some ambiguous expenses, I will pay for it myself. I earn a little more than her, and it is right to pay a little more, not to mention that after there is a baby, her focus will shift to the family.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>岁入各管，至于公共开销，支付宝小荷包设一家庭基金，两人每月各转四千于其中。房赁、房贷、柴米油盐皆由此出。偶有疏漏，忘以家庭基金结账，双方亦不以为意。若有模棱两可之支出，吾自掏腰包。吾之修为稍高于她，理应多出力，何况日后诞下小宝，彼女重心将移于家庭之上。</details></li><li>@DigitalOcean Only families that can&#x27;t save much money will hand over all their income to one person. Anyway, whether they give it or not, it will be spent in seven or eight ways. People who can save tens of thousands a year after excluding expenses will give the money to the other half.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@DigitalOcean 唯有积蓄甚微之家庭，方会将全部收入上缴于一人。反正给与不给，皆将花销殆尽。刨除开销一年还能能存个几十万的人，会把钱交给另一半吗😁</details></li>
