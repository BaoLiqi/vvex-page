            <h3>关于一次吵架产生的夫妻两个人谁控制大部分财产和遇到事情互相信任的问题</h3>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Nowadays, in many families, most of the savings are basically in the name of one person.
Perhaps the initial agreement was based on unconditional trust, but as they get along for a long time, conflicts will inevitably increase. The current divorce rate also shows that it is difficult for couples to have complete trust, after all, so many people say they will divorce and they do.
Initially, two people tied all their wealth into a family, and the other party would own half of it. Even in many families, one person manages the vast majority of the property alone.
On the one hand, the increasing crisis of trust generated by the impetuous marital relationship, and on the other hand, the current situation of the other party&#x27;s possession of their property, is like walking on a tightrope. Once the other party has a different intention, your property will inevitably suffer huge losses. How to balance this sense of insecurity?</p>

                <p>现在有很多家庭，大部分存款基本都是存在其中一个人的名下.
可能当初约定的时候是基于无条件的信任，但是相处久了矛盾不可避免的会增加很多，当前的离婚率也能说明夫妻之间很难存在完全信任，毕竟那么多人说离也就离了。
当初两个人把全部身家绑在一个家庭里，对方都要占有一半，甚至很多家庭是一个人独自管理绝大部分财产。
一方面是浮躁的夫妻关系产生的越来越多的信任危机，一方面是对方对自己财产的占有现状，就像在走钢丝，一旦对方有了异心，你的财产不可避免的蒙受巨大损失，这种不安全感怎么平衡呢？</p>

                <li>@gjw8u8 You have been completely brainwashed. What do you mean by bearing children for you? Aren&#x27;t children the woman&#x27;s children too? How do you know the woman doesn&#x27;t want a child?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@gjw8u8 你被洗脑洗的很彻底 什么叫给你生儿育女？儿女 不是女方的孩子吗 你怎么知道女方不想要个孩子呢？</details></li><li>We solve it through monthly reconciliation + balancing. The first is the principle: 1. Financial consumption is completely transparent, and both parties have the right to view each other&#x27;s consumption records and bank statements at any time (but usually they don&#x27;t look at it, it&#x27;s rare to be confused). 2. Consumption greater than 1000 requires the consent of both parties, and small amounts can be spent directly. 3. Income after marriage is the joint property of the husband and wife, not that the more you earn, the more you spend. 4. The property is jointly kept, and everyone has money in their hands. At the operational level: 1. After the monthly salary date, the accounts are reconciled to obtain the total family funds, how much is in the hands of the man and woman respectively, calculate the difference and transfer it to the other party, and after completion, the amount in the hands of the two people is always equal. Monthly expenses can be obtained by subtracting the monthly income from the difference between the total assets of the two months, so all expenses are always borne jointly by the two, which is fair. Everyone has money in their hands, which is convenient for spending money at ordinary times. Monthly reconciliation ensures that large monthly expenses can be discovered immediately, and there is no room for concealment. Separate accounts are set up for some special items that are not involved in the above calculations, such as raising children, buying a house fund, pre-marital property, etc. # The significance of the balancing model is first of all the principle: I believe that a family is built through the joint efforts of family members, and everyone has the responsibility to contribute and contribute to the family, and has the right to protect their rights and interests. Moreover, from the perspective of equality for all, everyone should have 50% of the rights and obligations. Based on this basic principle, the following conclusions can be drawn: Money should be split equally (earn together and spend together, whether morally or legally, it should be like this) Spending money should have the same right to speak (couples have equal rights to family property, so they should have the same right to speak) In order to achieve the above goals, balancing is a reliable and effective solution: 1 Monthly balancing to ensure equal distribution of income Income is naturally shared, and no one will ask the other party for money every month, which affects self-esteem 2 Monthly balancing to ensure that expenses are shared jointly Whoever pays at ordinary times is the same, and unusually large amounts will be discovered immediately every month 3 Each person holds 50% of the assets, so at least for economic issues, it can ensure that everyone has equal right to speak To prevent extreme situations where one party acts recklessly, ensure that large expenses must be agreed by both parties # Summary The balancing system is designed to solve the above contradictions. Under this system, it can ensure that family income is always shared, family support is always shared, and everyone is an equal family member with equal rights and mutual respect.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我们是通过每月对账+平账来解决的首先是原则：1 财务消费完全透明，双方随时有权查看对方各种消费记录银行流水（但通常不会看，难得糊涂）2 大于 1000 的消费需要两人同意，小额直接花就行。3 婚后收入是夫妻共同财产，不是说多赚多花。4 财产共同保管，每人手里都有钱。操作层面：1 每月工资日后对账，得到家庭总资金，男方女方各自手里有多少，计算差额转账给对方，完成后二人手中的金额总是相等的。每月开销可以从两月总资产差减去当月收入得到这样所有开支总是二人共同负担，公平。每人手里都有钱，平时花销方便。每月对账保证每月大额花销立刻能发现，没有隐瞒空间。对于一些专项款项另立账户不参与上述计算，比如养娃买房基金婚前财产什么的# 平账模式的意义首先是原则：我认为，一个家庭，是家庭成员共同努力下构建的，每个人都对家庭有责任付出，贡献，同时也有权利保护自己的权益。并且，从人人平等角度，每个人都应该拥有 50%的权利和义务以这个基本原则出发，可以得到以下推论：挣钱应该平分（一起挣一起花，不管是道德还是法律，都应该这样）花钱应该各自有相同话语权（夫妻对家庭财产有平等的权利，所以理应有相同话语权）为了实现上述目标，平账是一个可靠，有效的解决方案：1 每月平账，确保收入平分收入自然共享，不会有某人每月向对方要钱影响自尊的行为2 每月平账，确保支出共同承担平时谁掏钱都一样异常大额每个月会立刻发现3 每人持有 50%资产，那么至少对于经济问题，可以确保每个人有平等话语权防止一方乱来的极端情况确保大额开销必须双方同意# 总结而平账系统就是为了解决上述矛盾，这个体系下，可以确保家庭收入永远共享，家庭支持永远共同承担，每个人都是有平等权利互相尊重平等的家庭成员。</details></li><li>If there is no trust, you can&#x27;t be a couple.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>一但不信任就做不了夫妻了</details></li><li>1.

I am willing to give you/me the money to manage as the economic foundation of the family because I trust you/love you/and spend my life with you. 2. I must give you the money as a deposit in exchange for your trust in me/love me/and spend my life with me. If it is 1, the relationship between husband and wife is very harmonious, and this kind of question will not be raised at all. If it is 2, it has nothing to do with who manages the money, it is obviously a matter of love and trust.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>现在很多婚姻和家庭都是因果倒置：1 ，我因为信任你/爱你/和你过一生，所以愿意把钱给你/我作为家庭经济基础管理。2 ，我必须要把钱给你作为担保金，换取你信任我/爱我/和我过一生。是 1 ，夫妻关系就很和谐，压根不会提这样的问题。是 2 ，这和谁管钱有个 P 关系，明明是感情与信任问题。</details></li><li>@yinmin Why is it assumed that women can&#x27;t earn more than men?
