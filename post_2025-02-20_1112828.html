            <p>I just saw someone say Laifen&#x27;s electric toothbrush is not good.

I wonder how their hairdryer is? I used it once in a bath center and it felt okay. It felt similar to Dyson.

If the quality is reliable, it is indeed worth buying, after all, it is only 1/10 the price of Dyson.</p>

                <p>偶闻人言徕芬电齿不佳，未知其吹风机如何？吾尝于浴所一用，略感尚可，似与戴森无异。若品质可靠，则可购之，盖仅戴森什一之价也。此物若能助吾辈修士速干发束，亦可省却灵力温养之功，岂不美哉？</p>

                <li>I&#x27;ve been using Laifen LF03 for over a year and haven&#x27;t had any problems.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>徕芬 LF03 用逾一年，未见异状。</details></li><li>I bought one with a government subsidy and it&#x27;s been good for a few months. The wind power is indeed strong. Much better than the ones I used to use that cost a hundred or two.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>以国补购入一具，用之数月，颇感满意。其风力甚足，远胜往昔百两之物。</details></li><li>Yesterday&#x27;s post said Laifen toothbrushes are not good, and many people agreed and cited their own actual situations. Before that, some people said Laifen toothbrushes are good, and many people agreed and cited their own actual situations. emm, anyway, I bought Laifen&#x27;s toothbrush and have only been using it for a month. The durability remains to be verified by time, but the current usage experience is very good, and the appearance is also very good. I recommend buying it on JD.com, with a two-year warranty, making after-sales service relatively more convenient. It&#x27;s not very expensive, and with a two-year warranty, why not try it yourself? Maybe I&#x27;ll get ripped off and come to V station to post and complain.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>昨见帖云，徕芬电齿非良品，众人附议，引自身经历为证。然前亦有人赞之，亦引自身经历为证。吾亦购徕芬电齿，用之仅一月，耐用与否，尚待时日验证，然目前体验甚佳，其貌亦美。荐诸位于京东购之，享两年质保，售后更为便捷。价格不昂，质保两年，何不一试？或吾亦遭坑，届时必于此地发帖以泄愤。</details></li><li>It&#x27;s good, I bought one, and I regret not buying it sooner.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>甚好，吾购一具，恨未早买。</details></li><li>Let me tell you the most direct difference in physical experience. In the same max gear status, when blowing bangs and the front part of the top of the head from the top front, it is easy to feel the difference. The wind blown by Dyson is gentle and does not feel suffocating, while the wind blown by Laifen is impactful and has a slight suffocating feeling, which is the physical experience of a violent fan with great force. Some unknown brands of high-speed hair dryers in some hair salons also have the same problem.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>容吾直言其体感之异。同于极速档位之下，以风自头顶前上方吹拂刘海及前额，易感知其别。戴森之风柔和，无窒息之感；徕芬之风则具冲击之力，略有窒息之感，犹如暴力风扇，力大砖飞。似有理发店中无名高速风机，亦具此弊。</details></li><li>@apy I&#x27;m currently using Feike, 200+ feels like it has a lot of noise.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@apy 吾今用飞科，二百余，觉其噪音甚大。</details></li><li>Laifen&#x27;s toothbrush is a new business developed later, and the hairdryer is its old business. I bought a model that cost four or five hundred, which is obviously better than the various brands around 200.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>徕芬电齿乃后起之业，吹风机则为其旧业。吾购四五百之款，显胜二百左右之诸品牌。</details></li><li>Forgot which model of Laifen I bought. It&#x27;s a lite version. It&#x27;s very useful.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>忘徕芬何型号，购入 lite 版，甚好用。</details></li><li>Panasonic<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>松下</details></li><li>Good, I bought one and used it for a year and a half. Remember to clean the dust from the handle.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>佳，吾购一具，用之一年有半。当勤拂柄上之尘。</details></li><li>Dyson and Laifen each have one, and my wife thinks there is no difference.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>戴森与徕芬各一具，吾妻以为无异。</details></li><li>Good, I bought one for my home and also bought one for my parents. The wind is the strongest I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s best to use it with a suction cup for easy wall mounting.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>甚佳，吾家购一，亦为父母购一。其风力为吾所用之最，宜配吸盘，以便挂墙。</details></li><li>The wind is very strong, and the wind from the hottest setting feels cold, but it dries quickly. It is not as good as traditional hair dryers for styling, and is only suitable for drying.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>风力甚巨，最热档位吹出之风亦觉冷冽，然速干。造型之能不及传统吹风机，仅宜于速干发束。</details></li><li>Personally, I feel that it is more than enough. The wind is very strong. After using it for half a year, the air inlet at the bottom needs to be cleaned of dust immediately (otherwise it will feel like the wind is getting smaller). It can be magnetically attached to a base on the wall, which is very convenient. But I see you mentioned noise. To be honest, Laifen is quite loud when opened at high gear.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>以吾之见，比上或有所不足，然比下绰绰有余。风力甚足，用之半年，下方进风口需即时清理尘埃（否则觉风力渐小）。能以磁力吸附于墙上底座，甚便。然汝提噪音，实言之，徕芬开至高档，声甚大。</details></li><li>Bought a Dyson in 2017 (RMB2999), and bought a Laifen last year (RMB569). My wife gave both of them good reviews.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>一七年购戴森（价二千九百九十九），去年购徕芬（价五百六十九），吾妻皆赞之。</details></li><li>I forgot which model I bought from Jingdong for about 600 yuan. It has been two years since I got it, and it has been returned to the factory for maintenance once a year.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>于京东购入六百元左右之款，忘其型号，得已二年，每年均返厂维修一次。</details></li><li>It&#x27;s okay, I carry it with me every day. I use it after showering after running, basically every day.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>尚可，吾每日携之，跑步后沐浴毕用之，盖每日皆用。</details></li><li>Easy to use.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>易用。</details></li><li>The hair dryers, both the SE and the regular version, are quite easy to use, and have been used for a long time. But I also have two of their toothbrushes, and both of them broke down shortly after the warranty expired. Maybe I&#x27;m just unlucky.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吹风机，SE版与普通版皆甚易用，且用之颇久。然吾亦有其电齿刷二具，皆于保期刚过即坏，或吾运气不佳也。</details></li><li>Hair dryer lf03, also bought a toothbrush. Both are very easy to use. Recently I wanted to change my shaver. I&#x27;m going to wait for Laifen.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吹风机 lf03，亦购电齿刷，二者皆甚易用。近欲换剃须刀，吾欲候徕芬。</details></li>
