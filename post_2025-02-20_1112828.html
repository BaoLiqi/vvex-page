            <h3>徕芬的吹风机怎么样?</h3>

        <div class="content">
            <p>I just saw someone say that Laifen&#x27;s electric toothbrush is not good.

I don&#x27;t know about their hair dryer? I used it once in a bath center and it felt okay. It felt about the same as Dyson.

If the quality is reliable, it is indeed worth buying, after all, it is only 1/10 the price of Dyson.</p>

                <p>刚看到有人说徕芬的电动牙刷不好。

不知道他家的吹风机如何？我在洗浴中心用过一次，感觉还可以。感觉和戴森大差不差。

如果质量可靠，确实是可以买，毕竟只有 1/10 戴森的价格。</p>

                <li>I&#x27;ve been using Laifen LF03 for more than a year and haven&#x27;t had any problems.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>徕芬 LF03 用了一年多了 没出现过啥问题</details></li><li>I bought one with a national subsidy and it feels okay after using it for a few months. The wind power is indeed very strong. It is much better than the previous ones that cost a hundred or two hundred.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>国补买了一个，用了几个月感觉还行。风力确实很足。比以前的百来两百的好用多了</details></li><li>Yesterday&#x27;s post said that Laifen toothbrushes are not good, and many people agreed and cited their actual situations. Previously, some people said that Laifen toothbrushes are good, and many people agreed and cited their actual situations. emm, anyway, I bought a Laifen toothbrush and have only used it for a month. Durability needs to be verified over time, but the current experience is very good, and the appearance is also very good. It is recommended to buy it on JD.com, with a two-year warranty, and after-sales service is relatively more convenient. It is not very expensive, with a two-year warranty, so try it yourself. In case I get scammed, I will definitely come to V station to post complaints.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>昨天的帖子说徕芬牙刷不行，下面有不少人赞同并以自己的实际情况举例之前也有人说徕芬牙刷不错，下面有不少人赞同并以自己的实际情况举例emm ，反正我是买了徕芬的牙刷，刚用一个月，耐用性有待时间验证但是目前使用体验很不错，颜值也很好推荐在京东购买，两年质保，售后相对来说更方便一点又不是很贵，质保两年，自己试一下呗万一等我被坑了，我肯定也来 v 站发帖吐槽</details></li><li>Easy to use, I bought one, regret not buying it earlier.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>好用, 我买了一个, 后悔没早点买.</details></li><li>Let me talk about the most intuitive difference in physical experience. In the same maximum gear state, when blowing bangs and the front of the head from the top front, it is easy to feel that the wind blown by Dyson is soft and without a sense of suffocation, while the wind blown by Laifen has a sense of impact and slight suffocation. It is the physical experience of a violent fan that is powerful and can blow bricks, and some high-speed hair dryers of unknown brands in some barber shops also have the same problem.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>说个最直观的体感差异吧。同样最大挡的状态下，从头顶前上方吹刘海和头顶前部那一块的时候很容易就能感觉出来，戴森吹出来的风是柔和、没有窒息感的，而徕芬吹出来的风是有冲击感、有轻度窒息感的，属于是暴力风扇那种力大砖飞的体感，有些理发店的那种不知名品牌的高速吹风机也有同样的问题。</details></li><li>@apy I am currently using Philips, 200+ feels noisy.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@apy 我现在用的飞科，200+ 感觉噪音大。</details></li><li>Laifen&#x27;s toothbrush is a new business developed later, and the hair dryer is its old business. I bought the one that seems to be four or five hundred, which is obviously better than the various brands around 200 later.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>徕芬的牙刷是后来开发的新业务，吹风机是老本行我买的好像是四五百的那款，反正明显比后来各种品牌 200 左右的好一些</details></li><li>I forgot the model of Laifen, bought the lite version and it is very easy to use.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>徕芬的那个啥型号忘了 买的 lite 版 很好用</details></li><li>Panasonic<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>松下</details></li><li>Not bad, bought one and used it for a year and a half, remember to clean the dust on the handle.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>不错，买了一个用了一年半，记得清把柄的灰尘</details></li><li>We have both Dyson and Laifen, and my wife doesn&#x27;t think there is any difference.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>戴森和徕芬各有一个，我媳妇觉得没啥区别</details></li><li>Not bad, I bought one for my family and also bought one for my parents. The wind power is the strongest I have ever used. And it is best to use it with a suction cup for easy hanging on the wall.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>不错，我家里买了一个 给爸妈也买了  风力是我用过最大的  而且最好搭配吸盘用  方便挂墙上</details></li><li>The wind is very strong, and the wind blown out by the hottest gear feels cold, but it can dry quickly. The styling ability is not as good as traditional hair dryers, and it is only suitable for drying hair.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>风很大，最热的档位吹出来的风体感也冷冷的，但是很快能吹干。造型能力不如传统吹风机，只适合吹干。</details></li><li>Personally, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s enough to compare with the top, but it&#x27;s more than enough to compare with the bottom. The wind power is very strong. After using it for half a year, the air inlet below needs to be cleaned immediately (otherwise the wind power will feel smaller). It can be magnetically attracted to the base on the wall, which is very convenient. But I saw you mentioned the noise. To be honest, Laifen is quite loud when opened on high-end.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>个人感觉，比上不知道足不足，但比下绰绰有余，风力很足，用了半年，下方进风口需要即时清灰(要不然会感觉风力变小)。 能磁吸在墙上的底座上 很方便。  但是我看你提到噪音。说实话徕芬开高档声也挺大的</details></li><li>My wife gave both the Dyson (RMB2999) bought in 2017 and the Laifen (RMB569) bought last year good reviews.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>17 年买的戴森（ RMB2999 ），去年买的徕芬（ RMB569 ）这两个，我老婆都给予好评。</details></li><li>I bought the one for about 600 yuan on JD.com. I forgot what model it was. It has been two years since I bought it, and it has been returned to the factory for repairs once a year.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>京东购入 600 元左右那款忘了什么型号了, 到手两年, 一年返厂维修一次</details></li><li>It&#x27;s okay, I carry it with me every day, and use it after taking a shower after running, basically every day.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>还行吧，我天天都带身上，跑步完后洗完澡用，基本上天天用</details></li><li>Easy to use<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>好用</details></li><li>The hair dryer, one SE and one regular version are both quite easy to use, and I have used them for a long time. But I also have two of their toothbrushes, and basically they broke just after the warranty expired. Maybe I&#x27;m just unlucky.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吹风机一个 SE 一个普通版都挺好用的，也都用了挺长时间但是他们家牙刷我也有两个基本上都是刚过保就坏了，也有可能是我运气不好</details></li><li>Hair dryer lf03, I also bought a toothbrush, both are very easy to use, recently I want to change the shaver, I plan to wait for Laifen<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吹风机 lf03 ，牙刷也买了 都很好用，最近想换剃须刀，我准备等等徕芬</details></li>
