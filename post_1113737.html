        <h1>A Review of Nearly a Year of Unemployment (See How I Saved Myself)</h1>
        <h2>失业近一年的回顾（看我如何自救）</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>It's been almost a year since I became unemployed.

My last job officially ended on March 15, 2024, and since then, I've been in a "free developer" state.

I tried to find a job during this period, but there weren't many positions I could apply for. I only interviewed with one company, and it didn't work out. So, from July, I started investing heavily in independent development - as long as the library was open (closed on Mondays), I would spend almost the entire day there. After returning to my room at night, I would sometimes continue working until midnight.

My main focus is the crypto circle, mainly doing airdrop hunting and arbitrage (originally, I was waiting for the zkSync results in June, but it wasn't ideal, so I officially started independent development in July).

💰 Timeline of income turning positive:
✅ October 2024: The IPO script (Sui chain meme IPO) started generating income.
✅ December 2024: Arbitrage (Solana chain arbitrage between various DEXs) started generating income.
✅ December 2024: Someone on X proactively contacted me and sponsored me weekly to continue developing the arbitrage program (I also shared the code for them to use together).
✅ February 2025: Received a part-time job writing some simple crypto bots.

Among them, the income from IPOs and arbitrage is unstable, but the "fixed salary" from sponsorship + part-time job is about 20,000+ per month.

💡 Projects I've tried in the past few months, focusing on "quick development, quick launch, quick trial and error, quick switch to the next":

- Script to automatically mint Bitcoin Runes
- Image processing website
- Edited a few videos
- Script for batch staking Cosmos
- Twitter bot
- Bot to brush Sui transaction volume / number of transaction users
- And a few websites that are "not very useful" 😂
- Etc...

📌 Current status:
Safely at home, full-time "free development" (although income is still not stable enough).

🚀 Future:
Continue working hard and strive to retire early.

Short-term expectation: Find an arbitrage / Rust "real-world" development partner to share some of the workload!</p>
            <p>快一年了，失业至今。

上一份工作在 2024 年 3 月 15 日正式结束，从那天起，就一直处于“自由开发者”状态。

期间尝试过找工作，但能投的岗位不多，只面试了一家，最终无果。于是，从 7 月开始高强度投入独立开发——只要图书馆开门（周一闭馆），几乎泡一整天，晚上回房间后，有时还会继续干到半夜。

我的主攻方向是 币圈，主要做 撸空投 和 套利（本来 6 月在等 zkSync 结果，最终不理想，所以 7 月正式开始独立开发）。

💰 收入转正的时间线：
✅ 2024 年 10 月：打新脚本（ Sui 链 meme 打新）开始有收入。
✅ 2024 年 12 月：套利（ Solana 链 各 dex 间套利）开始有收入。
✅ 2024 年 12 月：X 上有人主动私信联系，每周资助我继续开发套利程序（代码也分享给他一起用）。
✅ 2025 年 2 月：接到一份兼职，写一些简单的币圈 bot 。

其中，打新和套利的收入 不稳定，但资助 + 兼职的“死工资”每月大概 2 万多。

💡 过去几个月尝试过的项目，主打一个“快速开发，快速上线，快速试错，快速下一个”：

- 自动 mint Bitcoin Runes 的脚本
- 图片处理网站
- 剪辑几支视频
- 批量质押 Cosmos 的脚本
- Twitter 机器人
- 刷 Sui 交易量 / 交易用户数的机器人
- 还有几个“没啥软用”的网站 😂
- 等...

📌 现状：
安心在家，全职“自由开发” （虽然收入还是不够稳定）。

🚀 未来：
继续努力，争取早日退休。

短期期望：找个 套利 / Rust “现实中的”开发搭子，分摊一点工作量！</p>

                <li>@glacer Find a meme launch platform similar to "pump.fun", then receive the news of successful launches🚀, and automatically buy in, then sell according to your own logic. I have statistics for December and January, and the probability of making money is over 80%.<br>@glacer 去找类“pump.fun”的 meme 发射平台然后去接收发射🚀成功的消息，自动买入之后就是按你自己的逻辑卖出我统计过 12 月，1 月的数据，这种赚钱概率在 80%以上</li><li>Same as a programmer, I usually make more than 10,000 a month from crypto trading.<br>同程序员，我做加密交易一般一个月 1w 多</li><li>@madantech Sure.

Many people inside actually develop it themselves and don't use the software. Many people simply use it as a communication group.<br>@caicaiwoshishui @Akagi201 推荐 solanamevbot 的 discord 群，里面其实好多人都是自己开发的，并没有用这个软件，不少人单纯把它当作交流群了</li><li>The income from IPOs and arbitrage is unstable, does that mean it fluctuates between 10k-200k?<br>打新和套利的收入 不稳定，意思是 1w-20w 这样波动？</li><li>Also in Hangzhou, we can meet offline when you have time, learn from each other and I can also give you some suggestions.<br>同杭州，有空可以线下聚一聚，学习一下也可以给你些建议。</li><li>I also left my job in January 2024 and haven't looked for a job since.
