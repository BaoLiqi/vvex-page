            <p>11 11 6 schedule for several years, I&#x27;m tired and can&#x27;t take it anymore. I feel my health is declining significantly.

Are there any good places for GO/Java development in Shanghai, V friends? A double weekend is all I need.

211 Bachelor&#x27;s degree, 7 years of experience, 3 companies, 2 of which are big companies. My current base salary is relatively high, but I&#x27;m willing to take a pay cut for a double weekend.

I&#x27;m thinking of finding a technology position in a bank or a securities company. Would that be better?</p>

                <p>11 11 6 ，好几年了，累了，遭不住了。感觉身体明显下滑。

上海 GO/Java 开发有什么好去处么，V 友们，双休就行。

211 本科，7 年了，3 家公司，2 家大厂。目前 Base 比较高，不过双休接受降一下。

我在想找一家银行科技岗，或者什么证券公司之类的科技岗，是不是好一点。</p>

You probably rarely get up and move around during your work hours, which means you&#x27;re sitting for about 90% of the 12 hours.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>这个上班强度，太透支自己了，你上班时间很少可以起来活动吧，等于 12 小时里有大概 90%的时间是坐着的</details></li><li>https://www.v2ex.com/t/1113245<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>https://www.v2ex.com/t/1113245</details></li><li>Don&#x27;t big companies have double weekends? I thought most were 995.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>大厂没有双休吗？我还以为大部分都 995 。</details></li><li>Leaving PDD will result in a significant pay cut.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>pdd 的出去工资要打骨折的</details></li><li>@biu7 Agreed. @proxytoworld saved 10k. @whyrookie Some are still 6 days a week. I know PDD and DeWu in Shanghai are like that. Huawei also has many 6-day work weeks. It&#x27;s said that some departments at JD have single weekends too? @saucer If it&#x27;s a stable job, I&#x27;ll take the pay cut. I can&#x27;t stand it anymore.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@biu7 赞@proxytoworld 攒了 1w@whyrookie 有几个还是 6 天的，上海我知道 pdd 还有得物。华为也是很多是 6 天，据说京东有些部门也是单休？@saucer 要是稳定的工作，骨折也认了，遭不住了</details></li><li>It feels like Shanghai is either foreign companies or relentlessly competitive companies, even more extreme than Beijing.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>怎么感觉上海除了外企就是卷厂，比北京还极端的样子</details></li><li>Bilibili<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>Bilibili</details></li><li>Relatively speaking, Byte is a compromise. Although it&#x27;s tiring, at least it has double weekends. I jumped to a foreign company for a year and a half before returning to Byte in the second half of last year.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>相对来说，字节算是一个权衡虽然也累，但是至少双休。之前我跳槽去外企待了一年半，去年下半年又回字节了。</details></li><li>@haiku Shanghai also has Bilibili, Byte, Tencent, which are all normal. And Ctrip is known for not being competitive, hahaha. Bilibili is also said to be okay. I feel like Hangzhou is ridiculously competitive, all driven by Alibaba. I don&#x27;t know what Hangzhou is like now. @Donaldo Is Bilibili still okay? It seemed like it was always laying people off a couple of years ago. What&#x27;s it like now?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@haiku 上海还有 b 站，字节，腾讯，都是正常的。还有携程是出了名的不卷哈哈哈。b 站据说也可以。我感觉杭州才是卷的离谱，都是被 ali 带起来的，不知道杭州现在怎么样。@Donaldo B 站还行么，前两年好像老是裁员，现在咋样？</details></li><li>@infun Byte does feel pretty good. Maybe I&#x27;ll try again. I didn&#x27;t get in after three interviews last time... Why did you go back after being at a foreign company? Aren&#x27;t foreign companies said to be the best place to end up, hahaha?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@infun 字节确实感觉还不错。要不我再试试，之前三面没进去。。外企咋又回去了嘞？外企不是说是最好归宿么哈哈哈</details></li><li>@SoldierL #9 Anyway, I heard that it&#x27;s very enjoyable to slack off at work, but I&#x27;m not sure about the layoffs.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@SoldierL #9 反正听说上班摸鱼很爽，裁员就不清楚了。</details></li><li>@Donaldo It seems to be the case for technology positions. I have two friends at Bilibili, one is a developer and the other is in operations. The developer is relatively free, but the operations person is working like crazy every day... They also have to do what kind of gala during the Lunar New Year, and it feels very tiring.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Donaldo 技术好像是的。我有俩朋友在 b 站，一个开发一个是运营，开发就比较闲，运营天天卷的要死。。过年还要搞什么晚会啊什么的，也非常累的感觉。</details></li><li>@SoldierL I stayed at Ctrip for seven years... If you don&#x27;t work hard, you can&#x27;t get into a foreign company... Less money.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@SoldierL 我在携程待了七年。。。不卷的上不去外企。。。钱少</details></li><li>It seems that financial IT positions require a strong background of experience, such as familiarity with xxx. However, if it&#x27;s a foreign company, you may have to take a 50% pay cut. Some state-owned enterprises are also like that, but foreign companies may withdraw, so aren&#x27;t state-owned enterprises better in some ways? I have a colleague who went to a state-owned enterprise after being laid off from a foreign company, the salary was halved, leaves at 7 pm, and has double weekends.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>金融 IT 岗貌似需要很强的经验背景，比如熟悉 xxx 之类的。不过如果是外企可能确实要打一半的骨折。某些国企也是，不过外企会撤，国企某种程度上是不是更好？我有同事外企被裁员后去了国企，工资对折，晚上七点走，有双休。</details></li><li>@infun That&#x27;s true, bro. But in these companies you mentioned, the work intensity seems okay, and the interview difficulty is also quite high. You&#x27;re a big shot...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@infun 真实了，老哥。不过你这几家，感觉工作强度都还可以，面试难度也都比较高，是个大佬。。</details></li><li>@yoiteshaw Oh, oh, thank you, bro. From what I understand, many financial jobs in Shanghai are mostly trading-related, using C++, which is also a challenge... As for state-owned enterprises, I heard that they are now both competitive and pay less... Many state-owned enterprises want to jump ship? I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@yoiteshaw 哦哦哦，感谢老哥。我了解下来上海很多金融都是交易类的多，用 C++的，这也是个难点。。。国企，我听说现在又卷钱又少呢。。好多国企都想往外跳？不知道是不是真的。。。</details></li><li>@SoldierL Search for &#x27;securities technology&#x27; on maimai and you&#x27;ll know what it&#x27;s like. It was okay four or five years ago, but now everyone wants to leave but can&#x27;t.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@SoldierL 去 maimai 搜一下证券科技就知道什么样了。四五年前还可以，现在都是想跑又跑不出去的</details></li><li>@berchtesgaden Got it. I&#x27;ve found that many state-owned enterprises are also like that... Many want to run to big companies. Isn&#x27;t that a two-way pursuit? @YaakovZiv I do get up and move around, but the time is just too long and exhausting. It really is draining.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@berchtesgaden get ， 我发现国企好多也是。。好多都想往大厂跑，这不是双向奔赴么。@YaakovZiv 起来活动倒是有，就是时间太长了，熬的。确实在透支</details></li>
