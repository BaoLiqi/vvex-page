            <p>11 11 6, it&#x27;s been several years, I&#x27;m tired and can&#x27;t take it anymore. I feel my body is declining significantly.

Any good places for GO/Java development in Shanghai, V friends? Just need weekends off.

211 Bachelor&#x27;s, 7 years of experience, 3 companies, 2 large companies. My current Base is relatively high, but I&#x27;m willing to take a pay cut for weekends off.

I&#x27;m thinking of finding a technology position in a bank or securities company, would that be better?</p>

                <p>十一十一又复六，数载已过，疲惫难当，身躯日渐不支。欲求沪上GO/Java清修之地，祈愿道友指点迷津，唯求双休之境。凡俗本科二一一，七载光阴，三家宗门，两入大派。今根基尚可，然为求双休，降薪亦可允之。或可寻觅银行科技之位，或证券公司之科技岗，以此安身立命，是否更佳？</p>

Huawei also has many that are 6 days, and it is said that some departments of JD also only have one day off? @saucer If it&#x27;s a stable job, I&#x27;ll accept the big discount, I can&#x27;t take it anymore.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@biu7赞@proxytoworld 积灵石万余@whyrookie 仍有六日者，沪上拼夕夕、得物是也。华为亦多六日，闻京东亦有部门单休乎？@saucer 若能觅得稳固道途，纵折损亦可忍，实难承受。</details></li><li>Why does it feel like Shanghai is all about competitive companies except for foreign companies, even more extreme than Beijing?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>怎觉沪上除却外企，皆乃内卷之地，其状更胜京城？</details></li><li>Bilibili<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>哔哩哔哩。</details></li><li>Relatively speaking, Byte is a compromise, although it&#x27;s also tiring, at least it&#x27;s weekends off. I went to a foreign company for a year and a half before, and went back to Byte last year in the second half.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>相对而言，字节可为折中之选，虽亦劳顿，然至少可享双休。吾曾入外企一年半，去年下半复归字节。</details></li><li>@haiku Shanghai also has Bilibili, Byte, Tencent, which are all normal. And Ctrip is famous for not being competitive hahaha. Bilibili is also said to be okay. I feel like Hangzhou is ridiculously competitive, all driven by Ali, I don&#x27;t know how Hangzhou is now. @Donaldo Is Bilibili okay? It seems like there were always layoffs in the past two years, how is it now?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@haiku 沪上尚有哔哩哔哩、字节、腾讯，皆为常态。携程素以不卷闻名。闻哔哩哔哩亦可。吾觉杭州内卷尤甚，皆阿里所致，不知杭州今况如何。@Donaldo 哔哩哔哩可否安稳？前两年裁员频频，今又如何？</details></li><li>@infun Byte does feel pretty good. Maybe I&#x27;ll try again, I didn&#x27;t get in after three interviews... Why did you go back to the foreign company? Isn&#x27;t the foreign company the best place to settle down hahaha<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@infun 字节确乎尚可。或可再试，前三次皆未得入…外企缘何又返？外企岂非最佳归宿乎？</details></li><li>@SoldierL #9 Anyway, I heard that it&#x27;s great to slack off at work, but I don&#x27;t know about layoffs.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@SoldierL #9 闻言摸鱼甚爽，裁员之事则未可知。</details></li><li>@Donaldo I think that&#x27;s true for technology. I have two friends at Bilibili, one is a developer and the other is an operator, the developer is more idle, and the operator is very competitive every day... They have to do some kind of gala during the Chinese New Year, which is also very tiring.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Donaldo 技艺一道确乎如此。吾友二人于哔哩哔哩，一为开发，一为运营，开发清闲，运营日夜操劳，春节期间亦需筹备晚会，甚为劳累。</details></li><li>@SoldierL I&#x27;ve been in Ctrip for seven years... You can&#x27;t get into a foreign company without being competitive... Less money.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@SoldierL 吾于携程待了七载…不卷无以入外企…薪资亦少。</details></li><li>It seems that financial IT positions require strong experience and background, such as being familiar with xxx. However, if it is a foreign company, it may indeed be a 50% discount. Some state-owned enterprises are also like this, but foreign companies may withdraw, are state-owned enterprises better to some extent? I have a colleague who was laid off from a foreign company and went to a state-owned enterprise, with half the salary, leaving at 7 pm, and has weekends off.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>金融IT之位，似需深厚经验背景，例如精通xxx云云。然若为外企，确或薪资减半。某国企亦如是，然外企或将撤离，国企于某种程度上是否更胜一筹？吾有同僚，自外企裁撤后入国企，薪资对折，晚七时归，享双休之境。</details></li><li>@infun That&#x27;s true, brother. But these companies of yours, I feel that the work intensity is okay, and the interview difficulty is also very high, you are a big shot...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@infun 老哥所言极是。然汝之几家，吾觉工作强度尚可，面试之难亦甚高，实乃修道大能…</details></li><li>@yoiteshaw Oh oh oh, thank you brother. I understand that many financial institutions in Shanghai are mostly trading-related, using C++, which is also a difficulty... State-owned enterprises, I heard that they are now competitive and have little money... Many state-owned enterprises want to jump out? I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@yoiteshaw 哦哦哦，多谢道友。吾所了解，沪上金融多为交易相关，所用C++，亦为一难…国企，传闻今既卷又少钱…甚多国企欲往外跳？不知真假…</details></li><li>@SoldierL Go search for securities technology on maimai to find out what it&#x27;s like. It was okay four or five years ago, but now everyone wants to run away but can&#x27;t.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@SoldierL 往脉脉寻觅证券科技，便可知其详。四五年前尚可，今皆欲遁而不能。</details></li><li>@berchtesgaden get, I found that there are a lot of state-owned enterprises... A lot of people want to run to large companies, isn&#x27;t this a two-way rush? @YaakovZiv I do get up and move around, but the time is too long, it&#x27;s exhausting. It&#x27;s really a drain.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@berchtesgaden 悟，吾亦见国企甚多如此…多有欲往大宗门者，岂非双向奔赴？@YaakovZiv 吾虽偶有起身活动，然时日过长，损耗气血甚巨。</details></li>
