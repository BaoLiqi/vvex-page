It&#x27;s not realistic. High-end restaurants require reservations, but you can eat beef and horse set meals at will. You won&#x27;t be hungry. #11 Basic communication translation software is fine. What you need to pay attention to is preparing to turn on roaming, or buy a local traffic card, or rent a wifi device, and try to ensure that the network is not disconnected. If it doesn&#x27;t work, there are Chinese people everywhere. You mutter to yourself in the air, and a Chinese NPC will randomly refresh to help you. In addition to visiting the check-in locations, spend more time doing things that ordinary people do, similar to experiencing living in another place for a day - normally go to the supermarket, take the subway for a walk (citywalk), ordinary restaurants / cafes / bakeries / hotels / supermarkets / parks, some details are completely different from the domestic experience, which is still very interesting, and you don&#x27;t necessarily have to rush to complete KPI goals to swipe check-in points. Note that hotels usually only allow check-in after 2 o&#x27;clock; subway transfers in downtown Tokyo are relatively complicated, so download the subway software in advance and familiarize yourself with the interface (Google map is also very useful). Some transportation tickets can be combined tickets / joint tickets, which is much cheaper, so do your homework in advance. (Private goods) Wandering around is a better experience than squeezing into a crowd of people at check-in points.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>有饕餮需预定，然东瀛民生，岂日日预定而食？高端馔席或需预约，寻常餐肆，随性而入即可饱腹。交流之事，译器足矣。然宜备漫游、流量卡或WIFI仪，防断网。若遇困境，华夏子民遍地皆是，可寻之求助。除却打卡胜地，亦可效凡人，体验异地之常。

Food: The low-end &quot;Big Three&quot; Sukiya, Yoshinoya, and Matsuya all have ordering machines with Chinese options, averaging under 50 CNY per person. For mid-range and high-end restaurants, see Google Map or Tabelog. Note that the Japanese default rating is 3 stars. Google Map 4-star+ shops are basically for tourists and are not recommended, as you are likely to encounter &quot;yin yang&quot; menus. High-end restaurants usually require reservations. Stores that are unwilling to serve non-Japanese customers usually occur in high-end traditional restaurants. Payment: Only a small number of small stores only accept cash. Chain stores can all swipe cards. VISA is the best in terms of compatibility, followed by AMEX (there is no need to apply for a JCB specifically. JCB and AMEX have mutual recognition agreements in Japan). Many domestic credit cards have high overseas offline cashback, which is more cost-effective than WeChat Alipay. Travel: iPhone can open Suica to support UnionPay credit card recharge. If you have friends with Android, you can open an Icoca or Passmo, etc., and switch them through the gate. There is no difference in use for tourists. Note that many rural areas such as Kyushu and Okinawa still require cash to buy tickets. For first-time independent travel, unless you want to take the Shinkansen, it is not recommended to buy any packages or one-day tickets, etc., because the fare algorithms for JR メトロ 私鉄 are complicated, and it is easy to lose money if you do not strictly follow the planned itinerary. Taxis are expensive. If you really want to take one, note that Japanese taxis are opened and closed by the driver. You can use Didi or Uber (5-800 yen more than directly hailing one). Accommodation: Tokyo and Osaka are always expensive. Hotel tidal effects are obvious in other places, with weekends and holidays doubling or tripling in price. In rural areas such as Sendai, you can stay in a hotel with hot springs for 200 RMB on weekdays. Himeji costs 600 for private soup + breakfast and dinner. Shopping: Almost all business districts and bustling streets in Japan are built around stations. Even in Tokyo, it takes 10 minutes to walk away from the station and you instantly become a large rural area.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>鄙人曾旅居东瀛一年。食：御三家（食其家、吉野家、松屋），皆有中文点餐机，人均五十元以下。中高端食肆，可查阅Google Map或食べログ。东瀛人惯以三星为默认评分，故Google Map四星以上店家多为游客所向，恐遇阴阳菜单。高档餐馆需提前预约。不接待非日语顾客者，多为高档传统餐馆。支付：小店多现金，连锁店可刷卡， VISA 最佳，AMEX次之（不必专办JCB）。国内信用卡境外返点颇丰，胜过微信支付宝。行：iPhone可开Suica，支持银联卡充值。Android用户可备Icoca、Passmo，闸机处轮换使用，于游客无异。九州、冲绳等地仍需现金购票。初次自由行，除非乘坐新干线，否则不宜购套票、一日券，因JR メトロ 私鉄计费复杂，稍有偏差则易亏。出租车甚贵，乘车注意司机开关车门，滴滴 Uber 亦可（较路边招手贵5-800日元）。住：东京大阪居甚不易。他处旅馆，潮汐效应显著，假日价格倍增。仙台乡间，二百人币可宿平日含温泉旅馆。姬路私汤加一泊二食，亦不过六百。游：东瀛商圈多环车站而建，东京离车站步行十分钟，便如入乡野。</details></li><li>1. Air tickets and airport departure 1. It is recommended to choose Fliggy and compare it with Qunar. Fliggy&#x27;s international flights are about three or four hundred cheaper. (You can also compare other platforms). You can check the price for each day before and after, sometimes the difference is quite big. 2. You need to fill in passport information when purchasing international flights, so you need to apply for a passport in advance. 3. International flights need to go through border inspection, and domestic international flights must be checked in at the counter. It is recommended to arrive at the airport about 3 hours in advance to check in. (Air China can pre-select seats in the applet, which requires Phoenix Miles points or 50 yuan) 4. The border inspection will ask some basic questions (where to go, e-visa, &quot;whether to work &quot;just say it doesn&#x27;t matter, no detailed investigation&quot;, return flight, hotel itinerary, etc.). There is no problem with stamping and letting go in three or four minutes. 5. You can fill in the electronic version of the entry form by searching for Visit Japan Web on Google, or bring a pen to fill in the paper version on the plane. (It is recommended to fill in the paper version, I don&#x27;t know which one of the electronic versions is unqualified and I was asked to refill the paper version) 2. Hotels 1. You can choose platforms: Fliggy, Booking, Agoda, etc. The focus is on comparing prices and reviews. Do not choose those that are very close to the station, it will be very noisy if you like to visit A central location within one kilometer of the station is based on the point. 2. When choosing a hotel, choose the actual number of people staying. The room rate is charged according to the actual number of people staying. See if the price includes tax. If it is not included, some hotels will have to pay consumption tax when checking in at the front desk. See if WiFi is provided. 3. It is recommended to choose more upscale hotels. The front desk communication and service are relatively higher, and the communication and stay experience will be better. 4. Basically, all disposable daily necessities other than towels in hotels are placed in the lobby, and will not be reserved in the room. 5. The domestic voltage in Japan is 110v. When carrying domestic electrical appliances and electronic products, pay attention to the input power of the charger. Mobile phones and the like can be charged directly without a adapter. High-power ones need to purchase a transformer. 6. Some hotel TV programs are chargeable. It is best to check the check-in guide in the room and the TV prompts. There is no need to watch them, otherwise you will be charged when you check out. 7. The hotel&#x27;s toilet paper can be flushed directly, and there are special bags for Sophie to put in. 8. The basic check-in time for hotels is after 14:00, and check-out is before 11:00. Luggage storage is provided. 3. Traveling in Japan 1. iPhone wallets can be used to handle electronic transportation cards. You can charge as much as you use. Moreover, transportation cards can be used to buy things, and convenience stores and shopping malls can use them. 2. Japanese subways are divided into limited express, semi-express, and ordinary. The speeds are different. They all swipe the card once to enter and exit the station. Limited express tickets require an additional limited express fee. You can buy them at the station or someone will check with you on the train. If you don&#x27;t have one, just make up the fare directly; some trams charge the same price for the entire journey. You don&#x27;t swipe when getting on the bus, but you swipe when getting off; for JR lines (usually airports or long distances) and buses, search for precautions on Little Red Book in advance. 3. It is recommended to use Google Map, which provides detailed information on transfers and train times, and you can also book restaurants. 4. Focus: People don’t do security checks, and even airports don’t use handheld security scanners. 5. Buy a wallet with a zipper, otherwise there is no place to put coins; bring a bag when you go out, there are really not many places to throw garbage. 4. Eating 1. Google Map can search for restaurants. Some restaurants will display words such as reservations, which require advance reservations or will not provide service. (Reservation seems to require registering an account or something, which is too complicated) 2. When checking out, see if there is a plate for receiving money at the front desk. In Japan, you usually put cash in the plate. Payment methods are usually cash, credit card, and some support Alipay. WeChat is rare. 3. When ordering food, point to the corresponding food and pair it with the all-purpose “this one”. Regular English can be understood, and if it doesn&#x27;t work, use a translation. Don&#x27;t care about losing face. 4. Convenience stores 711 and FamilyMart both have self-checkout machines. After you give the things to the clerk, just put the money into the machine. There are many machines on the street that sell water, so don’t worry about being thirsty. 5. Playing 1. Check the route and business hours on the map in advance. 2. You can buy tickets on-site for non-hot attractions, and it is best to buy tickets in advance for popular attractions. Fliggy and Booking both have them. You can also check ticket information by searching for corresponding attractions on Google Map. 3. Some inner halls of temples require you to take off your shoes to enter, so prepare comfortable shoes and socks. 4. Don’t worship randomly in Japanese temples and shrines. You don’t know what is being enshrined inside. 6. Other matters 1. It is recommended to apply for a Visa or Master, as UnionPay cards have a small range of applications. 2. Carry your passport, cash and bank card with you when you go out. 3. It is recommended to exchange 50,000 yen per person, and less than 100,000 is enough for two people. 4. Buy a traffic card in advance. There is also free public WiFi in Japan. You can turn on WiFi and search when you arrive at scenic spots, airports, and shopping malls.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>一、机务：一荐飞猪，较去哪儿价优。二、购票：护照务必先行，边检略问行程。宜备纸质入境单。二、酒店：飞猪、Booking、Agoda可择，远车站为佳。入住依实数，税费提前知，WiFi亦需问。高端体验更佳，日常用品多置于大堂。东瀛电压一百一，电器适配需查。部分电视节目收费，退房前务必留意。纸巾可冲水，苏菲备专用袋。下午二时可入住，上午十一时需退房，行李可寄存。三、出行：iPhone可办电子交通卡，随用随充。交通卡可购物，便利店、商场皆可。地铁分特急、准特急、普通，刷卡进出，特急另付费。有轨电车全程一价，JR线、公交提前查攻略。Google Map 胜用，换乘车次悉备，亦可预约食肆。安检宽驰。备拉链钱包，硬币颇多。四、食：Google Map可搜，部分需预约。结账置现金于盘中，现金、信用卡、支付宝可选，微信偶用。点餐指物，佐以&#x27;this one&#x27;；英语不惧，翻译软件备。便利店多自助结账机。五、游玩：提前查清路线及时令。非盛景可现场购票，热景点宜提前，飞猪、Booking皆备。寺庙内堂需脱鞋，备舒适鞋袜。神社不宜乱拜。六、其他：Visa、Master优先，银联偶用。护照、现金、卡随身。每人兑换五万日元足矣。提前购流量卡。景区、机场、商场多有免费WiFi。</details></li><li>@punching2012 #5 Good review of the night bus, usually directly to Shinjuku Station.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@punching2012 #5 夜间巴士甚佳，直达新宿。</details></li><li>In Kyoto, various alleys are also very good for strolling and taking pictures.

If there are many people, the photos will be tourist check-in photos. When the weather is good, you can walk along the Kamogawa River and feel the leisure of the locals. If you like coffee and desserts, Kyoto has many nice little cafes. If you are tired, you can walk into one that catches your eye.

Unless you make a reservation, individuals are generally used to entering and exiting Suica directly, so they prefer express. However, the riding experience of the Shinkansen and limited express is indeed better. The car is also more beautiful- Unless you encounter a low probability event, Google Map navigation can tell you the platform Number. So you can take the train directly from Google Map, enter the station with suica, and get on the corresponding platform. I have encountered temporary lane changes twice in small stations (platform abandonment, station failure). If you don’t know Japanese, you can only ask the staff. - International airports and large stations have Chinese Japanese employees. However, small places and subway stations may not. Practice English. If it is a big city or a popular attraction, it is easy to meet Chinese people. - Most Japanese people I have met can speak English, and even very old drivers have very standard accents. - It’s best to make a reservation for popular restaurants. Some places can’t wait until 22:00 if you don’t make a reservation. However, reservations are relatively dead, so how many people you reserve, you have to go as many people. Ordinary stores don’t matter. If you are alone, reservations will also be limited. - There are few breakfast shops in Japan, so you can only go to convenience stores if the hotel does not include breakfast. - Tax can be exempted for 5000 yen or more, so remember to bring your passport before shopping. - Prepare a small coin purse, there are more places to use cash, and some small shops only accept cash- It’s best to get permission to take pictures of others. It’s also polite- The scenery everywhere is very beautiful. I personally prefer temples, shrines, and parks. Japanese gardens are indeed very beautiful. I like to take pictures and collect various 御朱印s by the way. - I personally don’t care much about Universal and Disney. If you want to go, it seems that Mario watches and Harry Potter wands have rental services in China. - I personally prefer to soak in hot springs. Hakone is near Tokyo. I have been there before. It is a good place to climb mountains and soak in hot springs. Although recently Da S... There you can take a small train up the mountain, and each station along the way has a museum. It’s very nice to slowly play station by station and go to the hot springs at night.

You can Googlemaps search ピンクサロン. When I went in December, I explored and the shops near Otsuka refused foreigners, but the ones near Sugamo were okay. This is super cheap, you can launch for around 3,000 yuan (if you go during the day), Google the services inside yourself, but the overall age of the custom girls is older, but the technology is very good. The only authentic regular shops in Tokyo are Yoshiwara. Google Minowa Station and search for &quot;Senzoku&quot;, walk more than a kilometer to the red light district, and then explore it yourself. For the first time, I recommend 60 minutes, which is between 2.5-50,000. The basic services are also okay, but the appearance of the custom girls is definitely not top-notch. The higher the price, the better the appearance. I played a 90,000 120-minute one before my friend, and he said it was very beautiful. Generally, there are people greeting you at the door, and 80% of foreigners can spend. Foreigner fee +5,000. If your Japanese is good, you can negotiate not to pay, but if you encounter someone saying that foreigners can&#x27;t do it, don&#x27;t negotiate, just leave. Japanese people hate this kind of disrespect for rules. Japanese needs to learn this sentence, are foreigners okay? Gai Jin Dei Mo Dai Jou bu? Gai Jin Dei Mo Dai Jou bu? Ask if the store accepts foreigners when entering the store, otherwise everything will be 0.
