It&#x27;s not realistic. High-end restaurants require reservations, but you can easily eat cheap meals without reservations. #11 For communication, translation software is basically enough. What you need to pay attention to is to prepare roaming, or buy a local SIM card, or rent a WiFi device to ensure that the internet is not disconnected. If that doesn&#x27;t work, there are Chinese people everywhere. Just mutter to the air and a Chinese NPC will randomly appear to help you. In addition to visiting the popular spots, spend more time doing things that ordinary people do, like experiencing living in a different place for a day - go to the supermarket, take the subway for a walk (citywalk), visit ordinary restaurants/cafes/bakeries/hotels/supermarkets/parks, some details are completely different from domestic experiences and are very interesting. Don&#x27;t rush around trying to check off a list of top attractions like you&#x27;re trying to complete some KPI. Note that hotels generally only allow check-in after 2 PM; subway transfers in Tokyo&#x27;s city center are quite complicated, download a subway app in advance and familiarize yourself with the interface (Google Maps is also very useful). Some transportation tickets can be purchased as passes/joint tickets, which are much cheaper, do your research in advance. (Personal opinion) Wandering around is a better experience than squeezing into crowds at tourist spots.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@punching2012 #7 吃饭要预约的情况有，但你反过来想想，难道在日本工作生活的人天天吃饭都要预约嘛，也不现实。高端餐厅预约制，牛马套餐那还不是随便吃 doge 不会饿着的。#11 交流翻译软件基本就行了，你要注意的是准备开好漫游，或者买当地流量卡，或者租个 wifi 设备，尽量保证网别断。实在不行，中国人遍地都是，你对着空气喃喃自语，会随机刷新中国人 NPC 帮你的除了打卡地，多花些时间做做普通人做的事情，类似体验换个地方生活一天——正常去超市、坐地铁瞎溜达（ citywalk ）、普通餐厅/咖啡店/面包店/酒店/超市/公园逛逛，有些细节是跟国内完全不同的体验，还是很有趣的，不一定非得奔着完成什么 KPI 的目标刷打卡点。注意，酒店基本都是 2 点后才能入住；东京市区地铁等换乘比较复杂，提前下好地铁软件，熟悉下界面（ Google map 也很有用）有些交通票可以买通票/联程票，便宜很多，提前做好攻略。 （私货）瞎溜达比去打卡点挤人堆体验更好</details></li><li>A friend said that when he ran a red light in Japan, he would say to his companions: &quot;Let&#x27;s go, Sseumnida.&quot;<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>一个朋友说，他在日本闯红灯的时候，会跟同行人说一句：lets go 斯密达。</details></li><li>I went there last year, here&#x27;s a little guide: https://www.mengke.me/blog/202405/Travels_In_Japan<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>去年去的，一点点攻略，https://www.mengke.me/blog/202405/Travels_In_Japan</details></li><li>I lived in Japan for a year. Food: The low-end &quot;Big Three&quot; - Sukiya, Yoshinoya, and Matsuya - all have ordering machines with Chinese options, and the average cost per person is under 50 CNY. For mid-range and high-end restaurants, check Google Maps or Tabelog. Note that the Japanese are used to a default rating of 3 stars. Restaurants on Google Maps with 4 stars or more are generally tourist-oriented and not recommended; you may encounter different menus for locals and tourists. High-end restaurants usually require reservations. Shops unwilling to serve non-Japanese speaking customers are generally high-end traditional restaurants. Payment: Only a few small shops accept cash only. Chain stores all accept credit cards. VISA is best for compatibility, followed by AMEX (no need to get a JCB specifically, JCB and AMEX have a mutual recognition agreement in Japan). Many domestic credit cards have high overseas offline cashback rates, which are more cost-effective than WeChat Pay or Alipay. Transportation: iPhones can enable Suica and support UnionPay credit card recharges. If you are traveling with friends with Android phones, you can also get an ICOCA or Passmo, etc., and switch between them when using the ticket gates. There is no difference for tourists. Note that many rural areas such as Kyushu and Okinawa require cash for tickets. For first-time independent travel, unless you are taking the Shinkansen, it is not recommended to buy any passes or one-day tickets, etc., because the lines are divided into JR, Metro, and private railways, and the discount algorithms are complex. You may lose money if you don&#x27;t strictly follow the planned itinerary. Taxis are expensive. If you really need to take one, note that Japanese taxis have drivers open and close the doors. You can use Didi or Uber (5-800 yen more than hailing directly). Accommodation: Tokyo and Osaka are expensive at any time. Hotel prices in other places have a clear tidal effect, with prices on weekends and holidays multiplying by 2 or 3. In rural areas like Sendai, you can stay in a hotel with an onsen for 200 RMB on weekdays. In Himeji, you can get a private onsen + one night and two meals for 600. Travel: Almost all of Japan&#x27;s commercial districts and lively areas are built around train stations. Even in Tokyo, 10 minutes away from the station on foot is like a rural area.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>在日旅居过一年。食：低端御三家食其家、吉野家、松屋，都有点餐机，可选中文，人均 50 CNY 以下。中、高端餐厅看 Google Map 或 食べログ，注意日本人习惯默认评分是 3 星，Google Map 4 星+ 的店基本纯是游客向的，不推荐，容易遇到阴阳菜单。高端餐厅一般需要预约。店家不愿意服务非日语客户的一般发生在高档传统餐厅。支付：仅有少量小店是現金だけ，连锁店都可以刷卡，兼容性来说 VISA 最好，其次是 AMEX （专门办 JCB 没必要，在日 JCB 和 AMEX 有互认协议）。国内很多信用卡境外线下返点都蛮高的，比微信支付宝划算。行：iPhone 可开 suica 支持银联信用卡充值，有带着用 Android 的朋友一起的话，可以再开张 icoca 、passmo 之类的，切换着过闸机，游客使用没有任何区别。注意九州、冲绳等乡下地方很多需要现金购票。初次自由行，除非要坐新干线，否则不推荐买任何套票、一日券等，因为线路分 JR メトロ 私铁等优惠算法复杂，不严格依照规划行程走的话容易反亏。打车较贵，实在要打注意日本出租是由司机开关门的，可以滴滴 uber （比直接招手多 5-800 日元调度费）住：东京大阪什么时候都贵。其他地方酒店潮汐效应明显，周末和节假日房价 x2 ，x3 是常态。乡下如仙台 200 人民币可以住平日带温泉的酒店。姬路 600 可以私汤+一泊二食。游：日本的几乎所有商圈、热闹街区都是围绕车站兴建的。即便东京离开车站步行 10 分钟也秒变大农村。</details></li><li>1. Flight Tickets and Airport Departure	1. It is recommended to choose Fliggy. Compared with Qunar, Fliggy&#x27;s international flights are about 300-400 cheaper. (You can also compare other platforms.) You can check the prices one day before and after, sometimes the difference is quite large.	2. You need to fill in your passport information when purchasing international flights, so you need to apply for a passport in advance.	3. International flights need to go through border inspection, and international flights in China must be checked in at the counter. It is recommended to arrive at the airport about 3 hours in advance to check in. (Air China can pre-select seats in the mini program, which requires Phoenix Miles points or 50 yuan)	4. The border inspection will ask some basic questions (where to go, e-visa, &quot;whether you work (just say anything, no detailed investigation)&quot;, return flight, hotel itinerary, etc.). If there are no problems, the stamp can be issued in three or four minutes.	5. You can fill in the electronic version of the entry form by searching for Visit Japan Web on Google, or &lt;font size=4, color=&#x27;yellow&#x27;&gt;bring a pen&lt;/font&gt; and fill in the paper version on the plane. (It is recommended to fill in the paper version, I don’t know which electronic version is unqualified and was asked to refill the paper version). 2. Hotel	1. Platforms to choose from: Fliggy, Booking, Agoda and other platforms, focus on comparing prices and evaluations, do not choose to be too close to the station, the railway will be very noisy, according to the places you want to visit, choose a central location within one kilometer of the station.	2. Choose the actual number of guests when choosing a hotel, the room rate is charged according to the actual number of guests; check whether the price includes tax. If it is not included, some hotels will have to pay consumption tax at the front desk when checking in, and check whether WiFi is provided.	3. It is recommended to choose more upscale hotels, the front desk communication and service are relatively higher, and the communication and accommodation experience will be much better.	4. Except for towels, other disposable daily necessities in the hotel are basically placed in the lobby and will not be reserved in the room.	5. The domestic voltage in Japan is 110v. When carrying domestic household appliances and electronic products, check the input power of the charger. Mobile phones and the like can be directly charged without a adapter. High-power devices need to purchase a transformer.	6. Some hotel TV programs are charged. It is best to check the check-in guide in the room and the TV prompt information. If it is not necessary, do not watch it, otherwise you will be charged when you check out.	7. The hotel toilet paper can be flushed directly into the water, and there are special bags for Sophie and the like.	8. The basic check-in at the hotel is after 2 pm, and check-out is before 11 am. Luggage storage is provided. 3. Travel in Japan	1. You can create an electronic transportation card in the iPhone wallet and recharge it as much as you use. And the transportation card can be used to buy things, convenience stores and shopping malls can use it.	2. Japanese subways are divided into limited express, semi-express, and ordinary. The speeds are different. You swipe your card once when entering and exiting the station. You need to pay an extra limited express fee for limited express trains. You can buy it at the station or someone will ask you to confirm it on the train. Just pay directly; some trams have one price for the entire journey. You don’t swipe when you get on, you swipe when you get off; search Xiaohongshu in advance for precautions when taking the JR line (usually to the airport or long distance) and buses.	3. It is recommended to use Google Map. The transfer and train number information are very detailed, and you can also book restaurants.	4. Key point: They don’t have security checks, and even the airport doesn’t use handheld security scanners.	5. Buy a wallet with a zipper, otherwise there is nowhere to put the coins; carry a bag when you go out, there are really not many places to throw garbage. 4. Eating	1. You can search for restaurants on Google Map. Some restaurants will display words such as reservation, which means you need to make a reservation in advance, otherwise they will not provide services. (It seems that you need to register an account to make a reservation, which is too complicated)	2. When checking out, check whether there is a plate for collecting money at the front desk. In Japan, you usually put cash into the plate for payment. Payment methods are usually cash, credit card, and some support Alipay. WeChat is rarely supported.	3. If you order food, just point to the corresponding food and say &#x27;this one&#x27;, which is universal. Regular English can be understood. If that doesn&#x27;t work, just use a translator and don’t be afraid of losing face.	4. Convenience stores 711 and FamilyMart have self-checkout machines. After giving the things to the clerk, just put the money into the machine. There are a lot of machines selling water on the street, so you don’t have to worry about being thirsty. 5. Play	1. Check the route and opening hours on the map in advance.	2. You can buy tickets on site for non-popular attractions. It is best to buy tickets in advance for popular attractions. Fliggy and Booking both have them. You can also check the ticket information by searching for the corresponding attractions on Google Map.	3. Some inner halls of temples require you to take off your shoes to enter, so prepare comfortable shoes and socks.	4. Do not worship indiscriminately in Japanese temples and shrines. You don’t know what is enshrined inside. 6. Other matters	1. It is recommended to apply for a Visa or Mastercard, as UnionPay cards have a small range of applications.	2. Carry your passport, cash and bank cards with you when you go out.	3. It is recommended to exchange 50,000 yen for one person, and 100,000 or less is enough for two people.	4. Buy a data sim card in advance. Japan also has free public WiFi. You can turn on WiFi to search in scenic spots, airports, shopping malls, etc.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>1. 机票及机场出发	1. 建议选择飞猪，对比去哪儿，飞猪国际航班便宜大概三四百。（也可以对比其他平台）可以看看前后各一天的价格，有时候差别挺大。	2. 购买国际航班需要填写护照信息，所以提前需要办理护照。	3. 国际航班需要过边检，而且国内的国际航班必须在柜台值机，建议预留 3 小时左右提前到达机场办理值机。（国航可以在小程序进行预选座位，需要凤凰知音积分或者 50 元）	4. 边检会问些基本问题（去哪、电子签证、「是否工作“随便说就行 不详查”」、返程航班、酒店行程等）没问题三四分钟就能盖章放行。	5. 入境单可以填写电子版 Google 搜 Visit Japan Web ，或者&lt;font size=4, color=&#x27;yellow&#x27;&gt;带只笔&lt;/font&gt;在飞机上填写纸质的。（建议填写纸质的，我电子的不知道哪不合格被要求重填纸质）2. 酒店	1. 平台可以选择：飞猪、Booking 、Agoda 等平台，重点对比价格和评价，不要选择离车站特别近的，铁轨会很吵，根据自己要逛的地方选择距离车站一公里内的中心地点。	2. 选择酒店时选择实际入住人数，房费是按实际人数入住人数收费的；看好价格是否含税，如果不含部分酒店要在前台办理入住时缴纳消费税，看好是否提供 WiFi 。	3. 建议选择高档一些的酒店，前台沟通和服务相对高一些，沟通和入住体验会好很多。	4. 酒店除毛巾外其他的一次性日用品基本上都会在大堂放着，房间内不会预留。	5. 日本国内电压是 110v ，携带国内家电和电子产品时看好充电器的输入功率，手机之类的可以直充 不需要转接头，大功率的需要购买变压器。	6. 部分酒店的电视节目是收费的，最好看下房间内的入住引导单和电视提示信息，没必要就别看，不然退房时会被收费。	7. 酒店的手纸可以直接冲水，苏菲啥的有提供专门的袋子装。	8. 酒店基本的入住在 14 点之后，退房在 11 点之前，都提供行李寄存。3. 日本出行	1. iPhone 钱包可以办电子交通卡，用多少充多少。而且交通卡可以买东西，便利店和商场都可以用。	2. 日本地铁分特急、准特急、普通，速度不同，都是进出站个刷一次卡，特急需要额外付特急费，车站购买或者车上会有人找你确认 没有直接补就行；部分有轨电车全程一个价，上车不刷，下车刷卡；坐 JR 线（一般都是机场或者远途）和公交提前小红书搜一搜注意事项。	3. 推荐使用 Google Map ，换乘和车次等相关信息很详细，还可以预定餐厅。	4. 重点：人家不安检，机场都不用手持安检仪。	5. 买个带拉链的钱包，不然硬币没地装；出门背个包，垃圾是真的没多少地方扔。4. 吃饭	1. Google Map 可以搜餐厅，部分餐厅会显示预约等字样，这种需要提前预约的 不然不提供服务。（预约好像需要注册什么账号，太复杂没搞）	2. 结账时看下前台是不是有收钱的盘子，日本结账一般都是把现金放到盘子里面，付款方式一般是现金、刷卡、部分支持支付宝，微信很少。	3. 点餐的话指着对应的食物配合“this one”万能，常规英文都能听懂，不行再上翻译，千万不要在乎掉面儿。	4. 便利店 711 和全家都有自主结账机，东西给店员后，直接在机器投钱就行。大街上买水的机器一大堆 不用担心口渴。5. 游玩	1. 提前在地图查下路线以及营业时间。	2. 不是热门景区可以现场买票，热门景点最好提前买票，飞猪和 Booking 都有，Google Map 搜索对应景点也可以查看票务信息。	3. 寺庙有些内堂需要脱鞋进入，准备好舒适的鞋袜。	4. 日本寺庙和神社不要瞎拜，不知道里面供奉的什么玩意。6. 其他事项	1. 建议办理一个 visa 或者 master ，银联卡应用范围比较小。	2. 出门随身带着护照、现金和银行卡。	3. 日元兑换一个人建议兑换 5 万日元即可，两个人兑换十万以下够用了。	4. 提前买流量卡，日本也有免费的公共 WiFi ，到景区和机场、商场之类的可以打开 WiFi 搜索。</details></li><li>@punching2012 #5 Good review for the night bus, it usually goes directly to Shinjuku Station.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@punching2012 #5 夜间大巴好评，一般直接到新宿站。</details></li><li>In Kyoto, all kinds of small alleys are also very good for strolling and taking pictures. Walking around is very relaxing. If you want to take great photos of popular spots such as Ninenzaka, Sannenzaka, and the area near Kiyomizu-dera, it is recommended to go on a sunny day before 8 am. If there are too many people, you will only get touristy photos. When the weather is good, you can walk along the Kamogawa River and feel the leisure of the locals. If you like to drink coffee and eat desserts, Kyoto has many nice little cafes. When you are tired, choose one that looks good and walk in, you can&#x27;t go wrong.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>京都的话，各类小巷子什么的也很好逛很好拍。走走逛逛很休闲。拍二年坂三年坂清水寺附近这种热门景点，想出片，建议找晴天早上八点前去。人多拍出来就游客打卡照了。天气好了，鸭川沿岸可以走走，能感受到当地人的闲适。如果喜欢和咖啡吃甜点，京都有很多不错的小咖啡馆，走累了可以调一个顺眼的 walk in ，基本不踩雷。</details></li><li>@punching2012 #11 Okay, is it difficult to communicate? I don&#x27;t know any Japanese at all, and I haven&#x27;t spoken English in a real-world setting before. ==================== Prepare a few commonly used English and Japanese words, and download a translation software just in case.

There is a resting place where you can watch the sunset and see the skyline. Last year on October 1st, we went there, and everyone climbed up and sat in that place, watching the sunset, the moon, and the stars.

Unless you make a reservation, I generally prefer to use Suica directly, so I prefer express trains. However, the riding experience of the Shinkansen and Limited Express is definitely better. The trains are also more beautiful. - Unless you encounter a small probability event, Google Map navigation can tell you the platform number. So you can directly use Google Map to take the train, use your Suica to enter the station, and go to the corresponding platform to board. I have encountered temporary track changes twice at small stations (platform waste, station failure). If you don&#x27;t know Japanese, you can only ask the staff. - International airports and large stations have Japanese staff who speak Chinese. But in small places, subway stations may not have them. Practice your English. If it is a big city or a popular attraction, it is actually easy to encounter Chinese people. - Most Japanese people I have encountered can speak English, and even very old drivers have very standard accents. - If you want to eat at popular spots, it is best to make a reservation. Some places only accept reservations after 10 PM. But reservations are very strict, you have to bring as many people as you reserved for. Ordinary shops don&#x27;t care. If you are traveling alone, reservations will be limited. - There are very few breakfast shops in Japan. If the hotel does not include breakfast, you can only go to a convenience store. - Purchases of 5000 yen or more are tax-free, so remember to bring your passport before shopping. - Prepare a small coin bag, there are many places where you need to use cash, some small shops even only accept cash. - If you want to take pictures of others, it is best to get permission, this is a kind of politeness. - The scenery is very beautiful everywhere. Personally, I prefer temples, shrines, and parks. Japanese gardens are indeed very beautiful. I like to take pictures and collect various goshuin (seal stamps). - I am not particularly interested in Universal or Disney. If you want to go, it seems that Mario watches and Harry Potter wands can be rented domestically. - Personally, I prefer to soak in hot springs. Hakone is near Tokyo. I have been there before, it is a good place for climbing mountains and soaking in hot springs. Although recently Da S... You can take a small train up the mountain, and there are art museums at each station along the way. Slowly play one station at a time, and go to soak in the hot springs at night, which is very nice. I wish you a pleasant trip.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>- 新干线和特急都要买急行券，然后两张一起过票检。除非预约，不然个人一般习惯 Suica 直进直出，所以更喜欢急行。不过新干线和特急的乘坐体验确实更棒。车也更漂亮- 除非碰到小概率事件，Google Map 导航是能告诉你 platform Number 的。所以坐电车可以直接 Google Map ，suica 进站，去对应 platform 上车即可。在小站碰到过两次临时换道（月台弃物，车站故障），如果不会日文，只能询问工作人员了。- 国际机场、大型车站这些地方都有会有中文的日方员工。但小地方，地铁站确实不一定会有。练习下英文吧。如果是大城市或者热门景点，其实很容易碰到中国人的。- 碰到过的大多数日本人都能说英文，甚至年纪很大的老司机口音还非常标准。- 吃饭要是网红点最好预约。有些地方没预约能等到晚上 22：00 后。但预约比较死，予約多少人，去也得多少人。普通店就无所谓。如果一人行，确实予約也会受限。- 日本鲜少有早餐店，酒店不包早餐的话就只能去便利店了。- 5000 円往上可免税，所以购物前记得带护照。- 准备个小硬币包吧，用现金的地方比较多，有的小店甚至只收现金- 拍他人的话，最好获得许可，这也是种礼貌- 各地风景都非常漂亮，个人更喜欢寺庙，神社，公园，日式庭院确实非常优美。我喜欢拍照顺便收集各种御朱印。- 环球，迪士尼我个人挺无感的。如果要去，像马里奥手表，哈里波特魔杖好像国内有租赁服务。- 个人更喜欢泡温泉，东京附近就是箱根了吧。之前也去过，是个爬山，泡温泉的好地方。虽然最近大 S……　那边可以乘坐小火车上山，沿途各站都有美術館。慢慢一站一站玩过去，晚上去泡温泉，非常不错。预祝旅行愉快</details></li><li>Kyoto Daitoku-ji Temple is worth it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>京都大德寺 你值得拥有</details></li><li>Say it three times: Coins, coins, coins!

Just Google Maps for ピンクサロン. When I explored in December, the shops near Otsuka refused foreigners, but the ones near Sugamo were okay. It&#x27;s super cheap, you can ejaculate for about 3000 yen (if you go during the day). Google the services yourself, but the girls in the adult entertainment industry are generally older, but their skills are very good. The only traditional, legitimate brothels in Tokyo are in Yoshiwara. Get out at Minowa Station on Google, then search for 「千束」, walk a little over a kilometer and you will arrive at the red-light district. Then explore on your own. If you&#x27;re playing for the first time, I recommend 60 minutes, which costs between 25,000 and 50,000 yen, they have it all. I usually spend a little over 20,000 yen at a shop, and the basic service is still okay, but the girls&#x27; looks are definitely not top-notch. The higher the price, the better the looks. A friend of mine played for 90,000 yen for 120 minutes, and he said she was very beautiful. Generally, there are people greeting you at the door, and 80% of them accept foreigners. There is a foreigner fee of +5000 yen. If your Japanese is good, you can negotiate to get rid of the fee, but if you come across someone who says foreigners are not allowed, don&#x27;t bother negotiating, just leave. The Japanese hate this kind of disrespect for the rules. You need to learn this sentence in Japanese: 外人でも大丈夫？ Gai Jin Dei Mo Dai Jou bu? 盖金 dei 莫呆胶布？Ask if they accept foreigners when you enter the shop, otherwise everything will be for nothing. In addition, the bad reviews on Google Maps are worth referring to, because the Japanese write reviews after playing.
