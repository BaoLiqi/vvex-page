                <li>mini7 is enough, air and pro are too big, can&#x27;t be used in bed<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>灵巧迷你七，足矣。空灵御器，皆过大，卧榻难用。</details></li><li>It is recommended to use the existing money to bottom out iQiyi US stocks, sell it after a month, and you should be able to buy the top configuration as you want.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>荐以现有灵石，抄底爱奇艺美股，月后售之，当可随心购得顶配灵器。</details></li><li>pro speakers are much better<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>御器之音，远胜也。</details></li><li>Just watching domestic streaming media, then I recommend an Android tablet. The cheap iPads have terrible screens, and the expensive ones are too low in cost performance if you only watch domestic streaming media.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>若仅观境内流媒，则荐安卓灵板。廉价灵果，荧幕不堪，昂贵之器，专司境内，性价过低矣。</details></li><li>Have the same idea, but after looking at it, the air has risen a lot in price. It should have been two or three thousand to buy the second generation air before. It&#x27;s not worth spending four or five thousand just to watch videos, so I&#x27;m going to check out Android.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾亦有此念，然观之，空灵已涨价甚多。昔购二代空灵，不过两三千灵石。仅为观影，耗费四五千，实不值当，且寻安卓灵板。</details></li><li>@Awes0me Mainly Bilibili in China, and YouTube and Netflix abroad. I have a relatively poor Honor pad that can&#x27;t download the Google suite.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Awes0me 境内主哔哩哔哩，境外油管网飞。吾有一荣耀灵板，颇为逊色，无法下载谷歌三件套。</details></li><li>Holding M4 pro and M2 air, I personally feel that the speakers of both models are not very good, and the volume is lighter than that of the mobile phone. Pro has 4 speakers, but air now also has speakers on both sides. If you don’t have any pursuit, it is recommended to directly buy a low-profile air with national subsidies.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>手持 M4 御器与 M2 空灵，吾个人觉之，二者音响皆不甚佳，且音量轻于手机。御器有四扬声器，然空灵今亦两侧皆有。若无甚追求，荐以国补购低配空灵。</details></li><li>For video launchers, I recommend Xiaomi 6s pro, I have already bought 2 of them, the sound effect is good<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>若为启动影视图，荐小米 6s 御器，吾已购二，音效甚佳。</details></li><li>The national subsidy can now be doubled if you copy the bottom at 4077. hahaha<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>国补今以四千零七十七灵石抄底，可翻两倍耶。哈哈！</details></li><li>@GLSLG The video and audio are good, but don&#x27;t touch it for games. Line moiré will appear when playing high-resolution games compressed to low resolution (I sold 6sp second-hand)<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@GLSLG 影音虽佳，然勿用之戏。高分辨之戏压缩至低分辨，则现线纹摩尔（吾以售二手 6sp ）。</details></li><li>Is it true iQiyi or real foreign streaming media? iQiyi Bilibili, which has low bit rates, are basically SDR. There is really no need to buy a cheap iPad. The screen and speakers of a cheap one are not good. The source of expensive ones is not worth wasting the screen, but if it is real streaming media such as Netflix, there is a lot of HDR content consumption. So iPad has a lot of advantages. The miniled or tandem oled iPad Pro with four speakers has a very good viewing experience.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>真乃爱奇艺，抑或国外正经流媒？爱奇艺哔哩哔哩，码率甚低，多为 SDR 。实无需购廉价灵果。廉价者，荧幕音响皆不佳。昂贵者，片源不甚适配，枉费荧幕。然若网飞之类真流媒，HDR 内容消耗甚多，则灵果优势甚大。迷你发光二极管或串联有机发光二极管灵果御器，配以四扬声器，观影之效极佳也。</details></li><li>My father was bored in the hospital, so I bought him one to watch TV and browse news. vivo pad air 8+128 Taobao 10 billion subsidy + government subsidy, about 1200+. Anyway, it&#x27;s enough for him to watch TV and browse news.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾父住院无聊，遂购一观荧幕阅新闻。vivo 空灵板，八加一百二十八，淘宝百亿加政府补贴，约一千二百灵石。总而言之，供其观荧幕阅新闻，足矣。</details></li><li>@GLSLG Can Xiaomi install Google&#x27;s suite?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@GLSLG 小米之器，可否安装谷歌三件套？</details></li><li>@yuejieyao #5 The speakers of the 24 pro are not even as good as the speakers of the 18 Pro<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@yuejieyao #5 二十四御器之扬声器，甚至不如一十八御器者。</details></li><li>@laommmm Just get an oppo pad3 8+128, it&#x27;s also more than 1200, with better configuration<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@laommmm 径取 oppo 板三，八加一百二十八，亦一千二百有余，配置更佳。</details></li><li>@WangStormstout Yes, it comes with it. Now it&#x27;s Douyin and YouTube launcher<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@WangStormstout 可也，内自带。今乃抖音与油管之启动器。</details></li><li>I also recommend Android hahaha<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾亦荐安卓，哈哈！</details></li><li>@clf #9 Yes, it&#x27;s just for audio and video, no gaming. It&#x27;s tiring to play games on a big screen.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@clf #9 然也，仅为听音观影，不事游戏。大屏戏耍，亦累也。</details></li><li>I have a Huawei matepad pro 14 storage<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾持有华为 matepad 御器十四藏。</details></li><li>@tongjiann I don’t know about this, but every night when I go to bed, when I switch from iphone14pm to M4 pro, I feel that the sound suddenly becomes smaller and dull, which is quite obvious<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@tongjiann 此吾不甚明，然每夜就寝，自 iphone14pm 转至 M4 御器之时，觉之声音骤然变小变闷，颇为明显。</details></li>
