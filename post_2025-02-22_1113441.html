        <h1>iPhone fell into the toilet, determined to change to a new phone</h1>
        <h2>掉进马桶的 iPhone ，换新手机的决心</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Last night, I experienced the worst moment of my life - my iPhone fell into the toilet. Although it has been washed clean, the psychological shadow is too big, and the phone is no longer the one I used to know. It's probably time to consider changing to a new phone, after all, the psychological "water" is not easy to remove... 

After taking the phone out of the toilet, I directly rinsed the earpiece and the bottom microphone with the tap, which resulted in water entering inside and the camera fogging up. Fortunately, the system, screen, and everything else are normal.

            <p>昨晚经历了人生中最惨的一刻——我的 iPhone 跌进了马桶。虽然已经洗干净了，但心理阴影太大，手机已经不再是我曾经认识的那个它了。大概是时候考虑换新机了，毕竟，心理上的“水”也不太好清除… 

从马桶里取出手机后，直接用水龙头冲洗听筒和底部麦克风位置，结果导致内部进水，摄像头出现起雾。不过，好在系统、屏幕等一切都正常。

                <li>Envy you, "the worst moment in life" is actually just an iPhone falling into the toilet, which shows how easy life is<br>羡慕你，“人生中最惨的一刻”居然只是 iphone 掉到马桶可见人生之轻松</li><li>I have two machines that fell into the toilet. One is like OP, the lens is foggy. After it dries, I decisively went to Apple to replace the new machine without saying anything😂. The other was inserted obliquely into the dry toilet. I didn’t dare to flush. After the shit dried, I brushed it off with a small brush and used it for another two years. Miserable.<br>我有两台机器掉厕所，一台像 op 这样，镜头起雾，等干了，果断去 apple 置换了新机器，啥也没说😂。另一台斜插进了旱厕，不敢冲水，shit 干掉了以后用小刷子刷干，又用了两年。惨。</li><li>Isn't it said to be waterproof? This little water shouldn't cause fog, or is it because the model is too old?<br>不是说防水吗 这点水应该不至于出现雾啊 还是说机型计较老</li><li>Are you not going to sell it on Xianyu?<br>不会准备咸鱼出掉吧</li><li>@povsister Waterproof glue will age. When you are 18 years old, you can stay up all night and still go to class the next day. Try it again when you are 81 years old?<br>@povsister 防水胶会老化，18 岁的你通宵一晚上第二天还能照样去上课，81 岁的时候你再试试呢？</li><li>It's okay, it's your own 💩 anyway<br>没事，反正是自己拉的💩</li><li>What's the big deal about falling into the toilet? I've seen it fall into a cesspool (dry toilet) 😅<br>掉马桶里有啥，我见过掉粪坑的（旱厕） 😅</li><li>It's hard to sell it second-hand if it's water damaged (dog head)<br>进水不好出二手啊(狗头)</li><li>Some people dream of falling into a cesspool<br>还有人做梦梦见自己掉粪坑</li><li>Turn it off and put it in rice, then sell it second-hand<br>关机丢到米里，然后出二手</li><li>@wegbjwjm It's useless. In this case, it's better to go to the phone store to disassemble and clean it as soon as possible.<br>@wegbjwjm 没用，这种情况，还不如赶快去手机店拆开清理</li><li>I'm curious if the toilet was flushed at the time, or if it was just finished and there was no time to flush.<br>好奇当时马桶是冲过的，还是刚大完没来得及充的。</li><li>No. Isn't iPhone always waterproof? I usually take it with me when I take a shower and rinse the earpiece and speaker directly. I haven't seen any water ingress or fogging.<br>不是。iPhone 不是一直防水吗。我日常带着洗澡也直接冲洗听筒和扬声器。也没见进水起雾诶</li><li>List it on Xianyu as a second-hand phone used by a beautiful woman<br>挂咸鱼，美女自用二手机</li><li>Won't the next one be "90% new, used by a girl"? (Just kidding)<br>不会接下来是 《女生自用 九新》 吧。。。 （开个玩笑）</li><li>@povsister OP said it was rinsed, I think it should be rinsing the microphone directly under running water.<br>@povsister op 说是冲洗，我想应该是开着水龙头对着话筒直冲这样</li><li>@chuugoku Waterproof glue will age. People have birth, aging, sickness, and death. Isn't it normal for the sealant of mobile phone components to age?<br>@chuugoku 防水胶会老化，人都有生老病死，手机元器件密封胶老化不是很正常的事情吗</li><li>Send the Xianyu ID, avoid the pit<br>咸鱼 id 发一下，避个坑</li><li>Just in time to sell original flavored second-hand iPhone<br>刚好出原味二手 iPhone</li><li>Xianyu: Beautiful woman's self-use machine, with original flavored water.<br>咸鱼：美女自用机，进原味水，。</li>
