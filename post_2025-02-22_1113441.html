            <p>Last night I experienced the worst moment of my life - my iPhone fell into the toilet. Although it has been cleaned, the psychological shadow is too great, and the phone is no longer the one I used to know. It&#x27;s probably time to consider getting a new one. After all, the &quot;water&quot; in my mind is not easy to clear...

After taking the phone out of the toilet, I directly rinsed the earpiece and bottom microphone with the faucet, which resulted in water entering inside and the camera fogging up. However, fortunately, everything is normal with the system, screen, etc.

                <p>昨夜历人生至暗之时，灵机坠入秽所。虽濯净，然心魔难除，此机已非昔日之物。或当购新机矣，盖心之污秽，实难涤荡...

自污秽中取机，竟以水喉直冲听筒与麦克风，致使灵气内泄，目镜蒙雾。然幸甚，系统屏幕等皆安然无恙。
