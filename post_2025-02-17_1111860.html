Preface

In this era, the wedding banquet, as a necessary process for the spiritual needs of the older generation and the recovery of favors costs, seems to be a calamity that young people cannot escape.

Although the concept of family is disappearing in our time.

Suffering from the fact that most people can only experience it once, and the so-called grade is more from the comparison around them, how can we accurately find our own needs and budget? 

I hope my experience will give you some small help.

Note: Information is time-sensitive and for reference only.

WARNING: Not suitable for people with mines at home.

## Wedding photos

Strictly speaking, this is not part of the wedding banquet, but photos are generally required to be played at the wedding, that is, wedding photos need to be taken before the wedding dinner. 

### Shooting process
The workflow of a general photography studio is like this: 

1. The woman needs to put on makeup, which takes 1 to 3 hours, and the man takes about 10 minutes. It has to be said that this industry is also highly specialized, and the woman&#x27;s makeup artist only does makeup for women. 
2. Then you need a photographer, photography assistant, and someone responsible for coordination | makeup touch-ups, etc., 3 to 4 people to assist in completing the indoor and outdoor shooting.
3. One day, you will basically be busy until dark. The later stages are retouching, selecting photos, and making photo frames.

### Studio selection
Find a local studio with a good reputation. It is best to try to find a lot of real reviews in various communities to choose. The general price is between 8000 - 15000. I think it is better to choose the cheaper one, because there is only so much time in a day, and adding money will not allow you to take more photos, unless the other party is willing to take photos for you for two days.

If you want to shoot in other places, such as Qingdao, Yunnan, directly find local studios in the destination city, the price should still be similar.  If you want to shoot in other places, just take a few days off to go, wouldn&#x27;t that be great?  If you find a local studio to shoot in other places, it will be much more expensive, after all, the studio needs to pay time and transportation costs. 

It is best to schedule the shooting time on a weekday, because there are fewer people in the outdoor scenery on weekdays, which is easy to shoot, and the staff must be happier to work on weekdays, because a lot of people want to be on weekends.

### Photo printing
That is, &quot;developing photos&quot;. First of all, the photography studio will definitely have photo albums and photo frames, but in fact, printing photos and wooden frames on Taobao are very cheap, and a 7-inch tabletop display only costs tens of yuan. You can choose more types online than the photography studio provides. 

Recommend a photo printing shop: Fuji Printing, printing 6-inch photos only costs 1 yuan each, and the effect is much better than the printing effect given by the photography studio. It may also be that the printer I found for this studio is not very good.

## Cigarettes, alcohol, and candy

### Candy

The bulk of the candy is chocolate and packaging. It depends on the needs. Some people don&#x27;t care, and some people just want to make it good. The price per serving is generally very good if it is more than 10 yuan, and it is also feasible to keep it below 10 yuan.

### Alcohol
Baijiu, red wine, beer

Beer is cheap, and everyone doesn&#x27;t seem to be picky.

Red wine is very deep. I think red wine is like beer for foreigners. Don&#x27;t wade into troubled waters. Don&#x27;t be surprised if it costs 15 yuan a bottle. It&#x27;s not impossible to spend 40 yuan a bottle. Hundreds of yuan is definitely an IQ tax. Moreover, there are very few people who can drink it. For example, in my area, dry red wine is mixed with Sprite, and there is no concept of sobering up at all.

For Baijiu, choose the appropriate grade according to the spiritual needs of the elders. My price reference channel is the lowest historical price on JD.com within one year, and use this price to negotiate with offline stores. In Jiangsu Province, I have directly become a fan of Yanghe Distillery, Haitian Dream, Haitian Dream.

Little knowledge: If you put the wine on the counter, there is something called a display fee. The winery has to pay to be placed in a good position. It is also a kind of advertising.

### Cigarettes
When it comes to cigarettes, the choices in different places seem to be surprisingly consistent: Zhonghua, Zhonghua, and it&#x27;s still Zhonghua.

Under normal circumstances, you should choose hard-boxed Zhonghua, retail price: 45/pack. If you have abundant financial resources, it should be soft Zhonghua. This area will also be matched with a few packs of Red Double Happiness cigarettes. I don&#x27;t know if there are any differences in different places.

There are discounts when buying cigarettes by the carton. The price I got for Zhonghua is 415/carton.

I recommend a website for checking cigarette prices. Here you can even see the wholesale price. I think it is quite informative.

&gt; https://www.cnxiangyan.com/

## Meal standard

The meal standard refers to the price of a table per meal. Generally, it is 10 people per table. If the meal standard is 2000, it is 200 yuan/person.

Meal standards definitely vary greatly from region to region (labor, venue costs, local economic level).

The evaluation criteria are deliciousness and price. If you don&#x27;t eat much nearby, you can only ask more people and refer to a lot of reviews. The price evaluation mainly depends on the menu, but looking at the menu is also a technical job. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t do this well, or I didn&#x27;t lead the choice of the restaurant, and I didn&#x27;t figure out how to determine the bottom price.

## Wedding planning
Wedding planning, that is, the wedding company, is an important part of the experience on the day. The decoration and rhythm control are handled by the wedding company.

People-wise, there are the so-called four diamond kings: host, makeup artist, photographer, and videographer. It is worth noting that there are also hosts for 500 yuan a day, and 2000 yuan a day. The same is true for others. Be careful that wedding planning companies cut corners in the labor link. Wedding planning is a very expensive part.

I haven&#x27;t found a way to determine the bottom price for meal standards and wedding planning, and it also has a bit of a meaning of selling to women.

The only suggestion is to look at a few more. Some cities, such as Nanjing, are said to be extremely expensive, and it is even better to go to nearby cities. The round-trip bus ticket is cheaper than in Nanjing...

Don&#x27;t make a decision too early, watch more! Watch more!

In addition, I think it is best not to have too many expectations for the follow-up shots and photos on the wedding day.

What are the secrets to taking pictures?

**Light, light, and still fucking light!**

However, the lighting in the place where you eat is not enough, you don&#x27;t have time to pose, and you can&#x27;t choose the scenery.

## Hotel accommodation

If foreign friends need accommodation, I refer to the Meituan price. You should know that Meituan, a monopoly, will definitely charge a lot of commissions. Don&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s 20% or 30%. It&#x27;s not difficult to get the hotel to spit out this commission and turn it into a discount.

## List of expenses

A messy list of expenses, which does not cover all expenses and has limited reference value.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

序

目前这个时代，婚礼宴作为上一代人精神需求和收回人情成本的必要流程，似乎是年轻人逃不掉的劫。

虽然家族这个概念在我们这个时代开始消失。

苦于大多数人只能经历一次，所谓的档次更是更多来自身边的对比，如何准确的找到自己的需求和预算呢？ 

希望我的经历给你一些小小的帮助。

注： 信息具有时效性，仅供参考。

WARING：不适合家中有矿人士阅读。

## 婚纱照

严格来说，这不是婚礼宴的一环，但是婚礼一般需要播放照片，也就是在办婚礼晚宴前，需要拍好婚纱照。

### 拍摄流程
一般摄像工作室的工作流程是这样的： 

1. 女方需要化妆，时间 1 ~ 3 小时，男方约 10 分钟，不得不说他们这个行业也是高度分工的，女方的化妆师只给女性化妆。 
2. 然后需要摄影师，摄影助理，一位负责协调 | 补妆的人士等，3 到 4 人协助完成室内和外景的拍摄。
3. 一天时间，基本会忙到天黑，后期就是修图，选照片，打相框这些后期流程。

### 工作室挑选
本地找个口碑较好的工作室，最好尝试在各种社区寻找大量真实的评价选择， 一般价格在 8000 - 15000 不等，我觉得选便宜的就好，因为一天时间就那么多，加钱也无法拍到更多的照片，除非对方愿意给你拍两天。

如果想去外地拍摄，比如青岛，云南，直接找目的城市的本地工作室，价格应该还是类似的，想去外地拍，直接连着休息几天去，岂不美哉？异地拍摄如果你找同城的工作室去外地拍摄，则会贵了非常多，毕竟工作室需要付出时间和交通费用。 

拍摄时间定在工作日是最好的，因为工作日外景人少，很好拍，还有就是工作人员工作日上班肯定是比较开心的，因为大量的人都想在周末。

### 照片冲印
也就是 “洗照片”， 首先摄影工作室肯定会有相册相框之类的，但是其实淘宝打印照片和带木框的很便宜，7 寸的摆台只要几十元。 网上你可选的种类比摄影工作室提供的丰富的多。 

安利一家照片打印店： 富士冲印，打印 6 寸的照片只需要 1 元一张，效果比摄影工作室给的打印效果好多了，也可能是我这家工作室找的冲印商不太行。

## 烟 酒 糖

### 糖腻

糖的大头是巧克力，包装，感觉还是看需求，有人觉得无所谓，有人就是想弄好的，单份价格一般到 10 元以上就是非常好的了，控制在 10 元以下也是可行的。

### 酒苦
白酒，红酒，啤酒

啤酒价格便宜，大家也似乎不怎么挑剔。

红酒的水很深啊，我觉得红酒就是外国人的啤酒，莫不要趟浑水，15 元一瓶不要吃惊，40 元一瓶也不是不行，上百那就是妥妥智商税了。而且会喝的人也很少，比如我这片区域就是干红配雪碧喝，完全无醒酒这种概念。

白酒还是依据长辈精神需求选择合适的档次吧，我的价格参考渠道是京东一年内的历史最低价，拿这个价位去和线下的店去谈。江苏地区这边直接化身洋河酒厂粉丝，海天梦、海天梦。

小知识：酒摆在柜台上，有个东西叫陈列费，酒厂是要给钱，才会摆在好位置的，也算是一种广告吧。

### 烟呛
烟，这件事似乎各地的选择出奇的一致：华子，华子，还他妈是华子。

正常情况还是选择硬盒中华，零售价：45/包，如财力雄厚那就应该是软华子。本地区也会搭配几条红双喜香烟，各个地方不知是否有不同。

香烟价格按条买都有优惠，我拿到的华子价格是 415/条。

推荐一个香烟价格查询网站，这里你甚至能看到批发价，我觉得参考性挺不错的。

&gt; https://www.cnxiangyan.com/

## 餐标

餐标指的是一餐一桌的价格，一般 10 人一桌，餐标为 2000 ，就是 200 元/人 了。

餐标肯定不同地区有较大的差异（人力，场地成本，当地经济水平）。

评价标准就是好吃和价格，好吃吗这个问题，你如果附近吃的少，只能多问问人，参考大量的评价。价格上的评价主要是看菜单，但是看菜单也是个技术活。很遗憾，我没有做好这件事，或者说我没有主导饭店的选择，也没有摸到如何确定底价。

## 婚礼策划
婚礼策划，也就是婚庆公司，是当天体验比较重要的一环，装饰和节奏把控都由婚庆公司负责。

人上就是所谓 4 大金刚，主持，化妆，摄影，摄像。值得注意的是 500 元一天的主持也有，2000 元一天的也有，其他人同理， 一定小心婚礼策划在人力环节缩水，婚礼策划可是很贵的一环。

餐标和婚礼策划我都没有找到如何确定底价的方法，而且也有点面向女方销售的意味在其中。

只能建议是都多看几家，有的城市比如南京，据说奇贵无必，甚至不如你去附近的城市找，包车票回来都比南京的便宜... 

不要过早做决定，多看！多看！

另外我觉得最好对婚礼当天的跟拍和照片不要有太多期待，

拍照的要诀是什么？

**光线，光线，还是他妈的光线！**

可是，吃饭的地方采光是不够的，你也没有时间摆姿势，也没办法去选景。

## 酒店住宿

如有外地朋友需要住宿，我参考的是美团价格。要知道，美团这种垄断地位的企业，抽成是绝对不会少的，20% 30% 也不要惊讶，试着让酒店方吐出这个抽成变成优惠也不是难事。

## 费用清单

杂乱无章的费用清单，不含盖所有费用，参考价值有限。

                <li>In my Northern rural village, the total cost is almost a fraction of OP&#x27;s. Our meal standard here is about 800 per table, excluding drinks, cigarettes and alcohol. With the meal standard reduced, the matching cigarettes and alcohol will naturally not be too expensive, so the banquet alone cost less than 30,000. I prepared two to three hundred servings of candy, which cost a few hundred yuan in total. My wedding photos were taken at my workplace, so the price is similar to OP. The wedding celebration here was handled by people in the village, which cost a total of more than 10,000, less than 20,000. But we also have to set off fireworks, which cost almost 10,000. Because there are few out-of-town friends, and there are large kangs in the village that can accommodate many people, the hotel didn&#x27;t cost much.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我这北方农村, 全办下来差不多是 OP 的零头, 我们这餐标差不多是 800 一桌, 不含饮料烟酒.餐标降了, 配套的烟酒自然也不会选太贵的, 这样一来光酒席差不多花了不到 3 万.糖我是置办了两三百份那样子, 一共就花了几百块钱.我婚纱照是在工作地拍的, 所以价格和 OP 差不多, 婚庆这边是选的村里的人操办, 拢共花了一万多, 不到两万.不过我们这还要放烟花, 差不多花了小一万. 因为外地朋友来的少, 加上村里都有大炕能住不少人, 酒店也没花几个钱.</details></li><li>Luckily I got married early, in 2011.
