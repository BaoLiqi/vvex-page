            <p>English cutter, an AI-powered English sentence learning tool.

The website is www.wordflow.click

Some say that to learn phonetics, you must pronounce words; to learn words, you must understand sentences. This is similar to machine learning languages. Machines do not look up dictionaries or memorize words. To make a machine understand the meaning of a word, you only need to show it how to use the word in a sentence. The famous masked language model (MLM) masks the word and asks the machine to infer the meaning from the context.

However, most English learning software for humans gives example sentences but relies on repeatedly looking at words to memorize them. So I made a memory software entirely based on sentences.

## 1. Understand English sentences with the cutter

One problem I encountered when I was in school was that I memorized many English words and learned grammar many times, but I still couldn&#x27;t understand long and difficult sentences. Later, I started practicing learning English through sentences. At that time, I started using a method to break down sentences, breaking complex long sentences into main components and modifiers to clarify the sentence structure. The general rule is to identify clauses, phrases, and non-finite verbs, and then mark the parts of speech to find adjectives and adverbs, and finally mark parallel structures.

For the specific method, a former New Oriental teacher has a good explanation on Bilibili. You can check it out.

It is indeed effective in practice, but the process of breaking down sentences takes a lot of time, and in the learning process, it is still relatively difficult for beginners to accurately identify various clauses, phrases, and non-finite verbs.

So, I made a tool that can automatically identify clauses, phrases, and non-finite verbs in sentences and mark the parts of speech, which can save a lot of time and allow you to understand the sentence structure more accurately.

## 2. Practice the cut sentences

After splitting the sentences using the above method, I also made a practice function, which is to mask all the words and silently write the meaning of the words according to the phonetics and Chinese meaning.

## 4. Finally

	1. Everyone is suitable for different English learning methods. Some people learn very quickly and don&#x27;t encounter many obstacles; others can&#x27;t learn no matter how hard they try. If you haven&#x27;t encountered this kind of problem before, please don&#x27;t try this tool.
	2. The tool is a bit expensive because adding custom sentences requires the use of large models, and the number of tokens issued each month has not yet been determined. But I can guarantee that my profit will not exceed 1/5 of the purchase price.

                <p>英 Cut 之器，乃人工智能驱动之习英语句法之宝。 网地乃 www.wordflow.click 也。 有云，欲习音标，必出声诵词；欲明词义，必解语句。此与机器习语之道相类，机不查典，亦不背词，欲使机解词意，只需示之于句中用法。名扬四海之遮蔽语言模型（MLM），乃遮掩词汇，令机观前后文，反推其意。 今之世人所用英语学习软件，虽供例句，然多依赖反复观词以记忆。故吾制一记忆之器，全基于句法之上。 

 ## 一、以 Cut 器解英语句

 忆昔求学之时，遇一难题，纵已记诵 বহু 英语词汇，亦习得诸语法，然仍不得解长难句之精髓。后乃始践行以句学英语之法。那时，便运一法，拆解语句，化繁为简，以明句之结构。其法大致为识别从句、短语、非谓语动词，并注词性，寻得形容词与副词，终标并列之结构。 若欲知其详法，B 站有前新东方授业师讲解甚佳，道友可往观之。

 实践而验，确有奇效。然拆解语句之过程，颇耗光阴。且于学习之际，欲精微识别诸从句、短语及非谓语动词，于初学者而言，甚为不易。 遂，吾铸一器，可自动识别句中之从句、短语及非谓语动词，并标词性，可省诸君甚多时间，亦可使君更为精准地领悟句子结构。

 ## 二、习练切割后之语句

 以如上之法拆分语句后，顺势作一习练之功。即遮蔽所有词汇，依音标、中文释义，默写词汇之意。

 ## 四、结语

 1. Each persona possess unique aptitude toward english learning.

If you haven&#x27;t encountered this kind of problem before, please don&#x27;t try this tool. 
 2. This Tool has a slightly premium pricing due to the utilisation of an AI Large language model when appending user-defined sentances.The Exact token distribution is yet to be confirmed though your investment would not be 20% more your paid amount.
