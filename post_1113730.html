            <p>The thing is, my parents suddenly said they booked a house. This house cannot be paid in installments, and my parents cannot afford the full price. They placed the order under these circumstances. They suddenly told me about it yesterday and asked me to discuss it and give them more than 200,000 yuan. I don't know what to say.</p>

                <li>A house that can be bought for more than 400,000 yuan will most likely not be sold for 100,000 in the future<br>总价 40 多万能买得到的房子，以后大概率 10 万都卖不掉</li><li>Being able to operate like this shows that they still treat you like a child and haven't considered your feelings<br>能这么操作，说明还把你当小孩，没考虑到你的想法</li><li>Are you stupid? Just throw the problem back to them. Are you going to sell blood?<br>傻吧 你再把问题丢回去不就好了 难不成要卖血</li><li>Is it for you or your brother?<br>给你买的还是给你弟买的？</li><li>A house with a price of 400,000 is likely a house in a small place. According to the situation in small places, it will likely continue to depreciate in the future, and the depreciation money will definitely be greater than the current deposit.<br>房价 40 万大概率是小地方的房子，按照小地方的情况后续大概率还会继续贬值，贬值的钱肯定大于目前的定金。</li><li>Blind guess, OP should have experienced a wave of marriage urging during the Spring Festival. OP's state of marriage makes parents unable to see hope in the near future. The elders decided to push it and simply do nothing and keep going, and booked the future wedding room without negotiation.<br>盲猜，OP 过年期间应该经历过一波催婚，OP 对婚姻的状态令父母近期看不到希望，二老决定 push 一把，干脆一不做二不休，不商量就把未来的婚房给订了</li><li>You should say: No money<br>你应该说: 没钱</li><li>No money, at most lose the deposit<br>没钱，顶多赔掉定金</li><li>It is easy to get a bank loan now, and farmers can also get a loan. Let them take out a loan to pay the house payment; then slowly repay the loan from the bank.<br>现在银行贷款很容易的，农民也能贷款，让他们贷款把房款付了；银行那边贷款再慢慢还咯</li><li>Many parents are like this, used to making decisions for their children.<br>很多家长都这样，替孩子做决策做惯了。</li><li>@kk2syc It wasn't bought for me, I am an only child<br>@kk2syc 不是给我买的，我是独生子</li><li>If you are the heir to the property, you can consider supporting it; if the value of the house is much greater than 200,000, and you only use your money to fill some gaps, you can consider it; if it is clear that you bought the house for another child, you can consider borrowing it; (To be honest, for all the people who complain about their parents, I subconsciously think this person is relatively selfish, of course this is my prejudice)<br>如果自己是财产继承者，就可以考虑支持；如果房子价值远大于 20 万，只是用你钱补一些空缺，可以考虑；如果明确是买了房子给另一个子女，可以考虑借；（实话实说，所有吐槽父母的，我潜意识认为这人比较自私，当然这是我的偏见）</li><li>@Kaisar Speechless<br>@Kaisar 太无语了</li><li>Then solve it according to the procedure of placing an order but not being able to afford it<br>那就按照下了订，但是买不起的程序来解决就是啦</li><li>@Messmer You are an only child, but it wasn't bought for you, what's the situation?<br>@Messmer 你是独生子，但是又不是给你买的，啥情况？</li><li>@DigitaIOcean The house now costs more than 400,000, and my parents only have more than 200,000 in savings. I am an only child, the heir to the property, and they suddenly told me about this and booked it directly without discussing it with me.<br>@DigitaIOcean 房子现在价格是 40 多万，父母存款只有 20 多万，我是独生子，是财产继承者，是突然跟我说了这件事，而且没跟我讨论直接下订了</li><li>@Messmer #12 This situation is indeed a bit embarrassing.<br>@Messmer #12 确实有点尴尬这情况。</li><li>It's true that they were wrong not to discuss it, but since you are the heir, it means your parents gave you a sum of money<br>没商量确实是他们不对，不过既然是继承者，说明是父母给了你一笔钱哦</li><li>@Messmer #12 A possible reference, you have no money or don't want to pay, but you also like the house. Just buy it first, and then take out a home mortgage loan (very low interest rate) and let your parents or yourself pay the installments.<br>@Messmer #12 一种可能的参考，你没有钱或者不想出钱，但房子你也看得上。 就先买了，然后房屋抵押贷款(利率很低的)，让父母或者自己支付分期款。</li><li>@loooooong2023 But I'm really speechless that they didn't discuss it with me and directly placed the order, and they can't pay in installments and can't afford the full amount<br>@loooooong2023 但我实在是无语没跟我讨论商量就直接下订了，而且无法分期付款又没能力付全款的情况</li>
