            <p>I use macOS for work during the day, and go home to play games and browse forums on Windows at night.
I always feel that Mac is a bit slow, with a sluggish feeling, and typing always feels unsmooth, especially when writing documents~

Today I was bored, so I specifically compared the input latency of the two systems.
Mac: m2pro 32g system 15.3.1, win: win11, 13600kf
Restarted the computer, typed randomly in the Chrome tab bar, and pressed directly with all fingers on the keyboard.
Divided into Chinese input method and pure English situations.

win: Needless to say, it&#x27;s absolutely instant, and I can&#x27;t feel any delay at all.

Mac&#x27;s results are divided into two situations
1. abc English input state, there is almost no delay, at least I can&#x27;t feel it. But to compare, Win is definitely faster.
2. Chinese input method state, I use WeChat input method, and I can feel the delay. After my fingers leave the keyboard for about 200ms, the screen responds.

Not to mention that Mac also has the problem that the input method becomes more and more stuck after a long time of booting. Especially when too many Chrome windows are open, the memory turns yellow and uses swap, the input delay affects the rhythm of typing.

Mac&#x27;s latency issues are also reflected in many system applications, such as the settings page, quickly switching options with the mouse. On the Activity Monitor page, clicking processes back and forth quickly with the mouse can cause the system to freeze.</p>

                <p>白天用 macos 办公，晚上回家用 win 打游戏，刷论坛。
总是感觉 mac 慢一拍，肉肉的感觉，打字总是感觉不流畅，特别是在写文档的时候~

今天无聊，特意对比了一下两个系统的输入延迟。
mac：m2pro 32g 系统 15.3.1 ，win：win11 ，13600kf
重新开机，chrome 标签栏乱打字，手指全部放在键盘上直接按。
分有中文输入法和纯英文的情况。

win：不用说，绝对的秒打秒出，根本感觉不到延迟。

mac 的结果，分两种情况
1. abc 英文输入状态，几乎没有延迟，至少我感觉不到。 但是要对比，绝对是 win 更快点。
2. 中文输入法状态，我用的微信输入法，体感都能感觉到有延迟，手指离开键盘约 200ms 后，才上屏响应完。

更别说 mac 还有开机久了，输入法越来越卡的问题。特别是 chrome 窗口开的太多，内存变黄用上交换后，输入延迟大道能影响打字的节奏。

mac 的延迟问题在系统应用里也有很多体现，比如设置页面，用鼠标快速切换选项。 活动监视器页面，用鼠标快速来回点进程，能把自己卡死。</p>

                <li>Initially, I came to this technical discussion post, hoping that some experts could share Mac system optimization experience. As a result, I saw another annoying post inciting antagonism, educating the green avatar user on the 32nd floor. You can see him in most posts comparing Windows and Mac. For ten years, he has been attacking Microsoft products and mocking Microsoft users like a murderer of his father, but he never outputs useful points, only uses rhetorical questions to create antagonism and pollute content in the forum. Fortunately, now there are more and more Mac bugs, and his remarks are more and more like a clown. He can only use fanboy as a mantra. In the era when Mac was better than Windows, this netizen was too powerful with borrowed authority 🤭 I wonder if he will call me, a Mac user, a Mac fanboy too?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>起初点进这个技术讨论帖，本期待能有大神分享 mac 系统优化经验。结果又看见令人反感的对立煽动回帖科普下 32 楼那位绿色头像网友，你可以在大部分有 windows 和 mac 比较的贴里看到他，十年如一日如同杀父仇人一样攻击微软系产品并群体攻击嘲讽微软用户但他从来不输出有益观点，只使用反问句在论坛制造对立污染内容。还好现在 mac bug 越来越多，他的言论越来越像🤡了，只能把 fanboy 当口头禅以前 mac 比 windows 好用的年代，这位网友狐假虎威不要太威风🤭 不知道他是不是也会把我这种 mac 用户称为 mac fanboy 呢？</details></li><li>Conclusion: The macOS version of WeChat input method is very poor.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>结论: 微信输入法 macOS 版本很拉</details></li><li>Although I agree that the quality of macOS has declined seriously, it&#x27;s not to your extent. It is recommended to control variables to investigate.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>虽然我认同现在 macos 质量下降严重但是到你这个程度真不至于，建议控制变量排查下</details></li><li>macOS is inherently laggy. Windows 10 basically does what you want, and software opens instantly. Win11 turns on WD and VBS to make it much more laggy, and it can be almost completely restored when turned off, but macOS doesn&#x27;t recover much even after turning off gatekeeper and SIP.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>macOS 本来就很卡，Windows10 基本都是指哪打哪，软件秒开，Win11 开了 WD 和 VBS 会卡不少，关了也能几乎完全恢复，但 macOS 是关了 gatekeeper 和 SIP 后也恢复不多</details></li><li>I think these are okay. Actually, the most inefficient thing is that the animation of macOS cannot be turned off. Some operations have formed muscle memory and feel that the animation is very obstructive… The longer macOS runs, the more bugs there are. I now find that there is also a delay in scrolling the mouse wheel, and restarting can eliminate the delay, which will occur after being turned on for more than a week. Windows never has this problem.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>这些我觉得还好，其实最影响效率的还是 macOS 的动画关不掉，有些操作形成肌肉记忆了就觉得动画非常碍事……macOS 运行时间越长其实 bug 越多，我现在发现鼠标滚轮滚动也会出现延迟，而且重启就能消除延迟，开机超过一星期就会出现。Windows 始终没有这个问题。</details></li><li>Your feeling is right, MacOS is much more laggy than Windows. My eight-year-old Intel CPU running Windows is more fluid than the m3 Pro chip. In fact, the reason is simple, how many users does MacOS have, how many users does Windows have, and Microsoft&#x27;s optimization over the years has not been in vain.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你的感觉是对的，MacOS 远比 Windows 卡，我八年前的 Intel CPU 跑 Windows 都比 m3 Pro 芯片流程，其实这个道理也简单，MacOS 才多少用户，Windows 多少用户，微软这些年优化不是白优化的。</details></li><li>The speed of wayland on Linux is now faster than Windows. Windows has slowed down a bit with Windows 11. However, macOS is indeed slow.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>现在 Linux 端 wayland 的速度比 Windows 还快。Windows 到了 Windows11 这里变慢了一点。不过，macos 确实慢。</details></li><li>Without Windows as a comparison, the speed is unclear. With the same WeChat input method, there are occasional delays when switching different applications and direct English input for the first letter.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>没有 windows 作为对比，不清楚速度。同为微信输入法，切换不同应用输入偶尔会有延迟和首字母直接英文输入</details></li><li>I feel it&#x27;s the fault of 15.3.1. After I updated it, the Chinese input method has a probability of automatically clearing the entered pinyin during typing.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>感觉是 15.3.1 的锅。我更新完后，中文输入法在打字过程中有概率自动清除输入的拼音</details></li><li>Why not use the built-in input method to test it?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>为啥不用自带输入法测一下</details></li><li>I think Win11 is very poor. With a 14th generation i5 and 4060, the window minimization animation is not smooth and always lags, but Mac is very smooth.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我觉得 win11 很烂，14 代 i5 和 4060 ，窗口最小化动画都不流畅，总会卡一下，Mac 就很流畅</details></li><li>Linux and macOS applications are slower to open for the first time, even very small applications. Windows applications open instantly.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>Linux 和 macOS 的应用，第一次打开都会比较慢，哪怕是很小的应用也快不了。Windows 的应用，简单的秒开。</details></li><li>I never use third-party input methods, it&#x27;s a basic common sense of information security.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>从来不用三方输入法，信息安全基本常识啊</details></li><li>@Nosub On the contrary, I think Windows is completely stuck, and macOS is still smooth.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Nosub 我反倒觉得 Windows 卡的不成样子，还是 macOS 流畅</details></li><li>Input method bug, restarting can solve it. You&#x27;re lucky it&#x27;s just lag, in severe cases it will show the rainbow circle, God knows what the input method was doing during that time.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>输入法 bug ，重启可以解决，你这还好是卡顿，严重的会彩虹圈，鬼知道输入法那段时间干什么了</details></li><li>In my personal experience, Win is far inferior to Mac, of course this is just a personal opinion, 👌<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>个人体验来说 win 远远不如 mac ，当然也只是个人观点，👌</details></li><li>I use both Windows and Mac, both using the English interface. I don&#x27;t install domestic software unless necessary/I don&#x27;t install extra software if the system can meet the requirements/I only use the built-in input method/I purchase paid software according to my needs. I don&#x27;t use any cracked versions. Windows is a third-generation Xeon Platinum 8375C+512GB@24H2 RAM+4090FE. Mac mini is [email protected]M1 single-core, which of course beats 8375C, but Mac has many software that open much slower than Windows/I haven&#x27;t encountered input method lag/I have encountered peripheral function failure on both, and restarting solves the problem (I haven&#x27;t encountered it in the last 2 years, before it was a Logi Options problem)/Long-term stability without shutting down Mac is significantly stronger than Windows (my Mac mini has not been reinstalled since I bought it at the end of 2020, and it has been OTA upgraded to the current 15.3.1) Windows needs to be reinstalled about every 6~9 months in the past few years (1~2 times because of Windows update failure)<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>Windows 和 Mac 同时用 都是用的英文界面 国产软件非必要不安装/系统自带能满足需求不安装多余的软件/输入法从来都只用自带的/付费的根据需求购买 不用任何破解版Windows 是三代志强白金 8375C+512GB@24H2 RAM+4090FE Mac mini 是 [email protected]M1 单核当然秒杀 8375C 但 Mac 有不少软件初次打开速度明显慢于 Windows/输入法卡顿没遇到过/外设功能失效两者都遇到过 都是重启解决问题(最近 2 年二者都没遇到过了 之前都是 Logi Options 的问题)/长时间不关机稳定性 Mac 明显强过 Windows （我的 Mac mini 从 20 年底买回来就没重装过系统 OTA 升级一直到目前的 15.3.1 ） Windows 过去几年 6~9 个月左右就需要重新安装下系统（有 1~2 次是因为 Windows 更新导致的故障）</details></li><li>@ACSOUV This is very simple, you open a VM virtual machine, use the same configuration, install Windows, MacOS, and Linux, and see who is lagging. Because I have been doing cross-platform development recently, MacOS in the virtual machine is basically very stuck. To put it bluntly, Windows and Linux can be used with lower configurations, but MacOS basically cannot be used, which in itself explains the problem.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@ACSOUV 这事吧，很简单，你开个 vm 虚拟机，用同样的配置，安装 Windows ，MacOS ，和 Linux ，看看谁卡顿就知道了，因为我最近一直在做跨平台的开发，虚拟机里面的 MacOS 基本卡的不行，直白点就是 Windows 和 Linux 多低的配置都可以用，MacOS 基本用不了，这本身就说明了问题。</details></li><li>The &quot;Settings&quot; of macOS is very outrageous. First, to open it, you have to go through a round of icon jumping. After the interface pops up, click on any item in the left sidebar, and the pages on the right all take seconds to switch. And the setting speed of Windows 11 has actually deteriorated from its previous version. Take out the old version of the Win control panel, and now these systems are no match for it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>macos 的「设置」十分离谱，首先打开它，就要先经历一轮图标跳跃，等弹出界面，点击左侧边栏任意一项，右边的页面都要秒级别才能切换。而 windows 11 的设置速度其实已经是比自己之前劣化过了，拿旧版 win 的控制面板出来，现在这些系统都没得打。</details></li><li>@SeaTac I also only use the built-in input method, but the biggest problem with the Mac&#x27;s built-in input method is not the delay. No matter how low the delay is, it&#x27;s useless. The accuracy of inputting alternative words is too low, far from the Win built-in input method.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@SeaTac 我也只用自带输入法，但是 mac 自带输入法最大的问题不是延迟，延迟再低也没用，输入备选词的正确率实在太低了，离 win 自带输入法差太多</details></li>
