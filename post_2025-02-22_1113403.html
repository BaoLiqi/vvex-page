            <p>Using macOS for work during the day and Windows for gaming and browsing forums at home. I always feel that macOS is a step slower, with a sluggish feel, and typing is always not smooth, especially when writing documents. Today, out of boredom, I specifically compared the input latency of the two systems. macOS: m2pro 32g system 15.3.1, win: win11, 13600kf After restarting, I typed randomly in the chrome tab bar, with all fingers placed directly on the keyboard. Divided into Chinese input method and pure English cases. win: Needless to say, it&#x27;s absolutely instant, and there&#x27;s no feeling of delay at all. The result of macOS is divided into two cases 1. abc English input state, almost no delay, at least I don&#x27;t feel it. But to compare, Windows is definitely faster. 2. Chinese input method state, I use WeChat input method, and I can feel the delay, and it takes about 200ms for my fingers to leave the keyboard before the screen is fully responded. Not to mention that macOS has the problem of the input method becoming more and more laggy after being turned on for a long time. Especially when too many chrome windows are opened and the memory turns yellow and is swapped, the input delay can affect the rhythm of typing. The delay problem of macOS is also reflected in many system applications, such as the settings page, switching options quickly with the mouse. In the Activity Monitor page, quickly clicking processes back and forth with the mouse can freeze itself.</p>

                <p>白昼操劳于苹果机，夜归则把玩视窗，游弋于论坛之间。总觉苹果机行缓一拍，宛若泥淖，键入之际，滞涩难畅，纂写文牍尤甚。今偶有闲暇，遂比对两系统之输入迟延。苹果机：M2 Pro 32G，系统15.3.1。视窗：视窗11，13600KF。重启，于览器之标签栏随意键入，指尖齐落于键盘之上。分中文与纯英两种境况。视窗，毋庸置疑，瞬发瞬至，了无迟滞之感。苹果机之果，分两种境况：一，ABC英文输入状态，近乎无滞，然比之，视窗确胜一筹。二，中文输入法状态，吾用微信输入法，体感可察觉有延迟，指离键盘约二百毫秒后，方有响应。况且，苹果机久用，输入法愈见迟钝之弊。尤以浏览器窗口过多，内存告罄，启用交换后，输入延迟之巨，足可扰乱笔耕之节奏。苹果机之迟滞，于系统应用中亦多有体现，譬如设置页面，鼠标疾切选项；活动监视器页面，鼠标频繁点选进程，足以令其卡死。</p>

                <li>Initially I came to expect this technical discussion post in order to find experienced user to share the experience of optimizing macOS. In the end I see more annoying posts setting up hostility and propaganda posters educating that green avatar user on the 32nd floor. You can see him on most the posts that are either mac or windows comparing, attacking Microsoft products as if he is avenging his father the same for 10 years. He only pollutes the forum with pointless questions that create animosity. Luckily macOS is getting buggier and buggier so he sounds like a clown more and more, he can only resort to fanboy. Back then mac was better than windows, this poster acts incredibly imposing. I wonder if he will refer to macOS users like me as mac fanboys?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>初入此技术论道之所，本望得见优化苹果机之经验分享。然所见者，乃煽风点火，徒增仇恨之辈，科普于三十二楼之绿衣道友。君可见其于凡视窗与苹果机之较贴，皆如丧考妣般攻讦微阮之物，十年如一日。彼辈从不建言献策，唯以反诘之语，于论坛之中，制造对立，徒污版面。幸甚，苹果机之弊日盛，其言论愈显可笑，唯能以“果粉”自诩。忆昔苹果机优于视窗之岁，此辈狐假虎威，不可一世。莫非吾等苹果机用户，亦将遭其“果粉”之讥乎？</details></li><li>Conclusion: WeChat Input Method macOS version is terrible<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>结论：微信输入法之苹果机版，实乃粗制滥造</details></li><li>Although I agree that macOS quality is declining seriously, it&#x27;s not to the point that you are saying, I suggest you use control variables to find the reason<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>虽吾亦觉苹果机之质日下，然君所言未免夸大，当以控制变量之法，寻本溯源为上</details></li><li>macOS is very laggy in the first place, Windows10 basically does what it points, and software opens in seconds. Windows11 will be a lot of laggy if WD and VBS are turned on. If you turn it off, you can almost completely restore it, but macOS is not much restored after turning off gatekeeper and SIP<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>苹果操作系统本就略显迟缓，然视窗十可瞬时响应，软件秒开。视窗十一，若启WD与VBS，则略有滞涩，然关闭之，则可复原如初。苹果操作系统，纵使门卫与SIP尽皆关闭，亦难复当年之勇。</details></li><li>I think these are okay, but the most inefficient thing is that the animation of macOS cannot be turned off. Some operations have formed muscle memory and feel that the animation is very troublesome...macOS has more and more bugs as it runs longer. I now find that the mouse wheel scrolling also has a delay, and restarting can eliminate the delay, which will appear after turning it on for more than a week. Windows never has this problem.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>前述诸端，尚可容忍，然最损效率者，莫过于苹果操作系统之动画特效，实难关闭。有操作已成肌肉记忆，反觉动画殊为碍事。苹果操作系统运行愈久，则程序错误愈多。吾今察觉鼠标滚轮滚动亦有迟滞，须重启方能消除，且一周后必现。视窗系统，断不复有此患。</details></li><li>Your feeling is right, MacOS is far more laggy than Windows. My eight-year-old Intel CPU runs Windows better than the m3 Pro chip. In fact, the reason is simple. How many users does MacOS have? How many users does Windows have? Microsoft&#x27;s optimization over the years Not for nothing.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>道友所感甚是，苹果操作系统较视窗系统，确有不及之处。吾八年前之英特尔处理器，运行视窗系统，尚胜于M3 Pro芯片。盖因苹果操作系统用户几何？视窗系统用户几何？微软多年之优化，岂能无功而返？</details></li><li>Now Linux wayland is faster than Windows. Windows has slowed down a bit here in Windows11. However, macOS is indeed slow.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>今Linux之wayland，其速已胜视窗系统。视窗系统至视窗十一之际，略有迟缓，然苹果操作系统，确乎稍逊。</details></li><li>Without Windows as a comparison, I don&#x27;t know the speed. With the same WeChat input method, there will occasionally be delays and the first letter will be directly entered in English when switching between different applications.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>未有视窗系统以为对比，实难知其速度。同为微信输入法，于不同应用间切换之际，偶有迟滞，且首字母常以英文形式直接输入。</details></li><li>I feel like it&#x27;s the fault of 15.3.1. After I updated, the Chinese input method has a chance to automatically clear the entered pinyin during typing<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾以为此乃15.3.1之过。自更新后，中文输入法于输入之际，有机率自动清除已输入之拼音。</details></li><li>Why not use the built-in input method to test<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>何不用自带输入法一试？</details></li><li>I think win11 is very bad. I5 14th generation and 4060. The window minimization animation is not smooth and will always get stuck. Mac is very smooth.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾觉视窗十一甚劣，纵有十四代i5与四千零六十之显卡，窗口最小化动画亦不能流畅，时有卡顿。反观苹果机，则如行云流水。</details></li><li>Linux and macOS applications, when opened for the first time, will be relatively slow, even if the application is very small. Windows applications, simple ones open in seconds.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>Linux与苹果操作系统之应用，初次开启，必显迟缓，即便体积甚小之应用亦难免。视窗系统之应用，简易者则可瞬时开启。</details></li><li>Never use third-party input methods, basic common sense of information security<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>从不用第三方输入法，乃信息安全之常识。</details></li><li>@Nosub I think Windows is so laggy, macOS is smoother<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>道友所言差矣，吾以为视窗系统迟钝不堪，苹果操作系统反觉顺畅。</details></li><li>Input method bug, restarting can solve it. Fortunately, yours is a lag, and severe ones will have a colored circle. God knows what the input method was doing during that time.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>输入法有错漏，重启可解之。君所遇乃卡顿，重者则见彩虹圈。无人知晓此输入法彼时正为何事。</details></li><li>From a personal experience, Win is far inferior to Mac, of course, it&#x27;s just a personal opinion, 👌<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>以吾个人之经验而论，视窗远逊色于苹果机，当然，此仅为个人之见，👌。</details></li><li>Windows and Mac use English interface at the same time, non-essential domestic software is not installed / the system comes with the ability to meet the needs without installing extra software / input method only uses the built-in / paid ones are purchased according to the needs. No cracked version is used. Windows is three generations of Zhiqiang Platinum 8375C+512GB@24H2 RAM+4090FE Mac mini is [email protected] M1 single-core of course kills 8375C, but many Mac software open significantly slower than Windows / input method is not stuck / both peripheral functions fail. Both are restarted to solve the problem (neither has been encountered in the past 2 years, before it was a Logi Options problem) / long-term non-shutdown stability Mac is significantly stronger than Windows (My Mac mini has not been reinstalled since it was bought at the end of 20, OTA has been upgraded to the current 15.3.1) Windows has needed to reinstall the system every 6~9 months in the past few years (1~2 times it was a failure caused by Windows update)<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>视窗与苹果操作系统并用，皆以英文为界面，非必要之国产软件一概不用，系统自带功能足以满足需求，无需另行安装任何软件，输入法仅用自带，付费软件则按需购置，绝不使用破解版。视窗乃三代志强白金8375C，配以五百一十二GB@24H2内存及四千零九十显卡，苹果迷你机则为[email protected] M1单核，秒杀8375C自不在话下。然诸多苹果系统所用软件之初启速度，皆远逊于视窗系统。输入法卡顿未曾遭遇，外设功能失效之事，二者皆有发生，皆重启可解（近两年未再遇，此前皆为Logi Options之问题）。长时不关机之稳定性，苹果系统远胜于视窗系统（吾之苹果迷你机自二十年末购入至今，未曾重装系统，皆以OTA方式升级至如今之15.3.1版）。视窗于过往数年，每隔六至九月便需重装系统，有一两次乃因视窗升级所致之故障。</details></li><li>@ACSOUV This thing is very simple, you open a vm virtual machine, use the same configuration, install Windows, MacOS, and Linux, and see who lags, because I have been doing cross-platform development recently, and MacOS in the virtual machine is basically very laggy, bluntly It means that Windows and Linux can be used with any low configuration, and MacOS can&#x27;t be used at all, which in itself explains the problem.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此事甚简，道友可启虚拟机，以同等配置安装视窗、苹果及Linux三大系统，观孰滞而后决。吾近来从事跨平台开发，虚拟机中苹果系统卡顿不堪，直言之，视窗和Linux配置再低亦可堪用，苹果则万万不能。</details></li><li>macos&#x27;s &quot;settings&quot; is very outrageous. First open it, and you have to experience a round of icon jumping. After the interface pops up, click on any item in the left sidebar, and the page on the right will take a second to switch. And the setting speed of windows 11 is already worse than the previous version. Take out the old version of Win&#x27;s control panel, and none of these systems can beat it now.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>苹果操作系统之“设置”，实乃离谱至极。初启之，需经一轮图标跳跃。待界面弹出，点击左侧边栏之任何项目，右侧页面皆需秒级方能切换。视窗十一之设置速度，已较之前有所劣化。若取出旧版视窗之控制面板，则今之系统皆不能与之匹敌。</details></li><li>@SeaTac I also only use the built-in input method, but the biggest problem with the mac&#x27;s built-in input method is not the delay, it doesn&#x27;t matter if the delay is low, the accuracy of the input candidate words is too low, far from the win&#x27;s built-in input method<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>道友亦只用自带输入法，然苹果自带输入法之最大问题，非延迟也。纵延迟再低，若输入备选词之准确率过低，亦是枉然。较之视窗自带输入法，相去甚远。</details></li>
