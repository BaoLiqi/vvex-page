        <h1>Feeling that macOS's interaction latency is poorly implemented</h1>
        <h2>感觉 macos 的交互延迟做的很烂</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I use macOS for work during the day and win at home for gaming and browsing forums at night.
I always feel that Mac is a bit slow, with a sluggish feel, and typing always feels unsmooth, especially when writing documents~

Today, out of boredom, I specifically compared the input latency of the two systems.
Mac: m2pro 32g system 15.3.1, win: win11, 13600kf
Restart, randomly type in the Chrome tab bar, and press directly with all fingers on the keyboard.
Divided into Chinese input method and pure English situations.

win: Needless to say, it's absolutely instant, and you can't feel any lag at all.

The result of mac is divided into two situations
1. abc English input status, there is almost no delay, at least I can't feel it. But for comparison, win is definitely faster.
2. Chinese input method status, I use WeChat input method, and I can feel the delay. After my finger leaves the keyboard for about 200ms, the screen responds.

Not to mention the problem that the input method on Mac becomes more and more stuck after a long time of booting. Especially when too many Chrome windows are opened and the memory turns yellow and uses swap, the input delay can affect the rhythm of typing.

The Mac's delay problem is also reflected in many system applications, such as the settings page, where you can quickly switch options with the mouse. On the Activity Monitor page, you can get stuck by quickly clicking back and forth on processes with the mouse.</p>
            <p>白天用 macos 办公，晚上回家用 win 打游戏，刷论坛。
总是感觉 mac 慢一拍，肉肉的感觉，打字总是感觉不流畅，特别是在写文档的时候~

今天无聊，特意对比了一下两个系统的输入延迟。
mac：m2pro 32g 系统 15.3.1 ，win：win11 ，13600kf
重新开机，chrome 标签栏乱打字，手指全部放在键盘上直接按。
分有中文输入法和纯英文的情况。

win：不用说，绝对的秒打秒出，根本感觉不到延迟。

mac 的结果，分两种情况
1. abc 英文输入状态，几乎没有延迟，至少我感觉不到。 但是要对比，绝对是 win 更快点。
2. 中文输入法状态，我用的微信输入法，体感都能感觉到有延迟，手指离开键盘约 200ms 后，才上屏响应完。

更别说 mac 还有开机久了，输入法越来越卡的问题。特别是 chrome 窗口开的太多，内存变黄用上交换后，输入延迟大道能影响打字的节奏。

mac 的延迟问题在系统应用里也有很多体现，比如设置页面，用鼠标快速切换选项。 活动监视器页面，用鼠标快速来回点进程，能把自己卡死。</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Initially, I clicked into this technical discussion post, hoping that a great god could share Mac system optimization experience. As a result, I saw another disgusting antagonistic inciting reply popularizing the green avatar netizens on the 32nd floor. You can see him in most posts comparing Windows and Mac. He attacks Microsoft products and group attacks and mocks Microsoft users like a father-killing enemy day after day for ten years, but he never outputs beneficial opinions, only uses rhetorical questions to create antagonism and pollute content in the forum. Fortunately, there are more and more Mac bugs now, and his remarks are more and more like a clown. He can only use fanboy as a mantra. In the days when Mac was better than Windows, this netizen was too majestic. I wonder if he will also call mac fanboy like me mac fanboy?<br>起初点进这个技术讨论帖，本期待能有大神分享 mac 系统优化经验。结果又看见令人反感的对立煽动回帖科普下 32 楼那位绿色头像网友，你可以在大部分有 windows 和 mac 比较的贴里看到他，十年如一日如同杀父仇人一样攻击微软系产品并群体攻击嘲讽微软用户但他从来不输出有益观点，只使用反问句在论坛制造对立污染内容。还好现在 mac bug 越来越多，他的言论越来越像🤡了，只能把 fanboy 当口头禅以前 mac 比 windows 好用的年代，这位网友狐假虎威不要太威风🤭 不知道他是不是也会把我这种 mac 用户称为 mac fanboy 呢？</li><li>Conclusion: WeChat input method macOS version is very bad<br>结论: 微信输入法 macOS 版本很拉</li><li>Although I agree that the quality of macOS has declined seriously now, it is not to your extent. It is recommended to control variables to investigate<br>虽然我认同现在 macos 质量下降严重但是到你这个程度真不至于，建议控制变量排查下</li><li>macOS is very laggy. Windows 10 basically points to where to hit, and the software opens in seconds. Win11 will be a lot laggy with WD and VBS turned on, and it can be almost completely restored when turned off, but macOS does not recover much after gatekeeper and SIP are turned off<br>macOS 本来就很卡，Windows10 基本都是指哪打哪，软件秒开，Win11 开了 WD 和 VBS 会卡不少，关了也能几乎完全恢复，但 macOS 是关了 gatekeeper 和 SIP 后也恢复不多</li><li>I think these are okay. In fact, what affects efficiency the most is that the animation of macOS cannot be turned off. Some operations have formed muscle memory and feel that the animation is very obstructive... The longer macOS runs, the more bugs there are. I now find that there is a delay in scrolling the mouse wheel, and restarting can eliminate the delay. It will appear after booting for more than a week. Windows always has no this problem.<br>这些我觉得还好，其实最影响效率的还是 macOS 的动画关不掉，有些操作形成肌肉记忆了就觉得动画非常碍事……macOS 运行时间越长其实 bug 越多，我现在发现鼠标滚轮滚动也会出现延迟，而且重启就能消除延迟，开机超过一星期就会出现。Windows 始终没有这个问题。</li><li>Your feeling is correct. MacOS is much more laggy than Windows. My eight-year-old Intel CPU runs Windows more smoothly than the m3 Pro chip. In fact, the principle is simple. How many users does MacOS have? How many users does Windows have? Microsoft's optimization over the years is not white optimization.<br>你的感觉是对的，MacOS 远比 Windows 卡，我八年前的 Intel CPU 跑 Windows 都比 m3 Pro 芯片流程，其实这个道理也简单，MacOS 才多少用户，Windows 多少用户，微软这些年优化不是白优化的。</li><li>Now the speed of wayland on the Linux side is faster than Windows. Windows has slowed down a bit to Windows 11. However, macOS is indeed slow.<br>现在 Linux 端 wayland 的速度比 Windows 还快。Windows 到了 Windows11 这里变慢了一点。不过，macos 确实慢。</li><li>Without Windows as a comparison, I don't know the speed. With the same WeChat input method, there will occasionally be delays and direct English input of initial letters when switching different application inputs.<br>没有 windows 作为对比，不清楚速度。同为微信输入法，切换不同应用输入偶尔会有延迟和首字母直接英文输入</li><li>I feel it's the fault of 15.3.1. After I updated, the Chinese input method has a probability of automatically clearing the input pinyin during typing.<br>感觉是 15.3.1 的锅。我更新完后，中文输入法在打字过程中有概率自动清除输入的拼音</li><li>Why not use the built-in input method to test?<br>为啥不用自带输入法测一下</li><li>I think win11 is very bad, 14th generation i5 and 4060, the window minimization animation is not smooth, it will always get stuck, Mac is very smooth<br>我觉得 win11 很烂，14 代 i5 和 4060 ，窗口最小化动画都不流畅，总会卡一下，Mac 就很流畅</li><li>Linux and macOS applications will be slower the first time they are opened, even if they are very small applications. Windows applications, simple ones open in seconds.<br>Linux 和 macOS 的应用，第一次打开都会比较慢，哪怕是很小的应用也快不了。Windows 的应用，简单的秒开。</li><li>I never use third-party input methods. It's basic common sense for information security.<br>从来不用三方输入法，信息安全基本常识啊</li><li>@Nosub On the contrary, I think Windows is very laggy, and macOS is still smooth<br>@Nosub 我反倒觉得 Windows 卡的不成样子，还是 macOS 流畅</li><li>Input method bug, restarting can solve it. You are lucky that it is just a lag, and it will be a rainbow circle in severe cases. God knows what the input method was doing during that time.<br>输入法 bug ，重启可以解决，你这还好是卡顿，严重的会彩虹圈，鬼知道输入法那段时间干什么了</li><li>In terms of personal experience, win is far inferior to mac, of course, it's just a personal opinion, 👌<br>个人体验来说 win 远远不如 mac ，当然也只是个人观点，👌</li><li>Windows and Mac are both used with the English interface. Domestic software is not installed unless necessary/The system's own can meet the needs without installing extra software/The input method always only uses the built-in one/Paid ones are purchased according to needs. No pirated versions are used. Windows is a third-generation Zhiqiang Platinum 8375C+512GB@24H2 RAM+4090FE Mac mini is [email protected]M1. A single core of course kills 8375C, but Mac has many software whose initial opening speed is significantly slower than Windows/Input method lag has not been encountered/Peripheral function failure has been encountered in both. Both are solved by restarting the problem (neither of them has been encountered in the last 2 years. Before that, it was a problem with Logi Options)/Long-term shutdown-free stability Mac is significantly stronger than Windows (my Mac mini has not been reinstalled since it was bought at the end of 2020. OTA is upgraded to the current 15.3.1) Windows in the past few years needs to reinstall the system about every 6-9 months (there were 1-2 times because of Windows update failures)<br>Windows 和 Mac 同时用 都是用的英文界面 国产软件非必要不安装/系统自带能满足需求不安装多余的软件/输入法从来都只用自带的/付费的根据需求购买 不用任何破解版Windows 是三代志强白金 8375C+512GB@24H2 RAM+4090FE Mac mini 是 [email protected]M1 单核当然秒杀 8375C 但 Mac 有不少软件初次打开速度明显慢于 Windows/输入法卡顿没遇到过/外设功能失效两者都遇到过 都是重启解决问题(最近 2 年二者都没遇到过了 之前都是 Logi Options 的问题)/长时间不关机稳定性 Mac 明显强过 Windows （我的 Mac mini 从 20 年底买回来就没重装过系统 OTA 升级一直到目前的 15.3.1 ） Windows 过去几年 6~9 个月左右就需要重新安装下系统（有 1~2 次是因为 Windows 更新导致的故障）</li><li>@ACSOUV This is very simple. You open a vm virtual machine, use the same configuration, install Windows, MacOS, and Linux, and see who is lagging. Because I have been doing cross-platform development recently, the MacOS in the virtual machine is basically lagging. To put it bluntly, Windows and Linux can be used with any configuration, but MacOS can't be used at all. This itself explains the problem.<br>@ACSOUV 这事吧，很简单，你开个 vm 虚拟机，用同样的配置，安装 Windows ，MacOS ，和 Linux ，看看谁卡顿就知道了，因为我最近一直在做跨平台的开发，虚拟机里面的 MacOS 基本卡的不行，直白点就是 Windows 和 Linux 多低的配置都可以用，MacOS 基本用不了，这本身就说明了问题。</li><li>The "Settings" of macOS is very outrageous. First, to open it, you have to go through a round of icon jumping. After the interface pops up, click any item on the left sidebar, and the page on the right will take seconds to switch. The setting speed of Windows 11 is actually worse than before. Take out the control panel of the old version of Windows, and none of these systems can beat it now.<br>macos 的「设置」十分离谱，首先打开它，就要先经历一轮图标跳跃，等弹出界面，点击左侧边栏任意一项，右边的页面都要秒级别才能切换。而 windows 11 的设置速度其实已经是比自己之前劣化过了，拿旧版 win 的控制面板出来，现在这些系统都没得打。</li><li>@SeaTac I also only use the built-in input method, but the biggest problem with the mac built-in input method is not the delay. Even if the delay is low, it is useless. The accuracy of input candidate words is too low, which is much worse than the win built-in input method.<br>@SeaTac 我也只用自带输入法，但是 mac 自带输入法最大的问题不是延迟，延迟再低也没用，输入备选词的正确率实在太低了，离 win 自带输入法差太多</li>
