            <p>First, let me introduce the background. My hometown is a 4th or 5th tier city in Guangdong. I have been working in Guangdong Province for many years, and I only go back to my hometown during the Spring Festival and National Day. The point I&#x27;m struggling with now is the fear of losing my job. I&#x27;ve been changing companies almost every year for the past two years, and I&#x27;m almost thirty years old. I only have an adult college degree. At the end of last year, I found a job and joined a small company as a programmer, with a salary of less than 10,000. If I build a house, it will basically use up all the money of me and my parents, and I have about 300,000 in savings. If I ask my sisters for some help, I can get 400,000. Now my family has given me the idea of whether or not to build a house, and asked me to decide whether to build or not...</p>

                <p>吾乃岭南鄙邑之人，奔波营生数载，常年游弋于粤地。唯岁末及国庆方返梓里。然近日心绪不宁，虑及失业之险。近两年，屡易其职，转瞬已近而立之年。虽有成人大专之学，然去年岁末觅得一职，于微末之企充当码农，薪俸不足万金。若重建宅邸，恐倾吾与双亲之所有。现手头薄资约三十万，若得诸姊襄助，或可至四十万。今家父家母将决断之权托付于吾，令吾定夺建与不建，实乃进退维谷...</p>

                <li>What&#x27;s the point of building a house with all your savings? Do your parents live in your hometown? Those who return to their hometowns to build houses are those who have made money outside and return home in glory to show off to their neighbors.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>倾囊筑室何益？尊亲居于老家否？返乡建房者，皆为在外有所成就，衣锦还乡以示乡里。</details></li><li>Given your income, age, and savings, my personal suggestion is to build. If you want to buy a house in the city in the future, the pressure will be very high, especially when you have to raise children. Although you are emptying your pockets to build a house now, one of the three major events in your life has been solved, and you have no loan worries. You can save money for marriage and raising children in the future, richly or poorly. Moreover, your parents can still enjoy twenty or thirty years, and the rebuilt house can also make them happy, which is rare! Furthermore, the older generation all have the obsession of rebuilding/remodeling old houses, to gain face in front of neighbors, and also hope that future generations will have a good place to live no matter how far they go. However, due to limited ability, they do not want to say it clearly to give pressure to their descendants (after all, everyone needs to contribute). In summary, I believe you will get an answer that returns to your heart.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>以君之收入、年龄及薄资计，予之愚见，可建。若将来于城内购房，压力甚巨，何况尚需抚育后嗣。今虽倾囊建房，然人生三件大事已解其一，且无负债之忧。日后积攒钱财，婚配育儿即可，丰俭由人。且尊亲尚可安享二三十载，重建之宅，亦可令其怡然自乐，实乃难得！再者，老一辈皆有重建/重装老宅之执念，于邻里面前争光，亦冀望后代无论身在何处，归来皆有佳所栖身。然囿于能力，不欲明言以予子孙后代压力（毕竟需众人出资）。综上，信楼主可得一归于内心之答案。</details></li><li>How far is it from the downtown area or the prosperous area of the county seat? If it is more than 1 hour from the city center and more than half an hour from the county seat, there is no need to empty your family&#x27;s savings of 300,000-500,000 to rebuild. Consider it when you have more idle funds.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>离市区、县城繁华地几何？若距市区逾一小时，距县城逾半小时，则无须倾尽家财三五十万以重建。待有更多闲散资金再作考虑。</details></li><li>In 2020, I spent 300,000 and my parents spent 300,000 in Jieyang, Guangdong, to build a three-and-a-half-story building at a cost of 600,000, but only one floor was renovated for living, and the exterior walls were not tiled. If you are still single and it is difficult to buy a house in your workplace in the future, then I suggest you do it. There are also advantages to marrying a girl in your hometown. It is not easy to build houses in rural areas now, and the approval procedures must be completed before doing it, otherwise it will be in vain.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>忆昔庚子年，吾于揭阳出资三十万，父母亦出资三十万，耗六十万筑三层半之楼，然仅装修一层而居，外墙亦未贴砖。君若仍为单身，日后难于工作地置业，则吾建议君为之。于老家娶妻亦有优势。今农村建房不易，审批手续需先行，否则徒劳。</details></li><li>My background is very similar to OP&#x27;s. I am about 30 years old, working in Guangzhou. My hometown is a 4th or 5th tier city in Guangdong. I also go back during the Spring Festival and National Day (or even if there is no need to go back, I don&#x27;t really want to go back). My savings are also close to 300,000, but I don&#x27;t have the support of my parents, because my parents don&#x27;t have much savings, and my father had a disease earlier, and his savings were almost exhausted (that is, if I want to build a house, I can only rely on myself). The slightly different thing is that because my place is not enough, I built it with my brother. My brother built three floors and I built two floors. The costs are shared separately, including the floor design and layout can be separated. (But my choice is to basically keep the same, unless there is something I care about) So maybe I can save a little bit. According to their estimates, the overall cost of my two floors is about 250,000 to 300,000. I was asked about it last year, and my choice was to build it (but everyone&#x27;s situation is different, and the experiences are also different, please refer to it carefully). My idea is to spend 200,000 to 300,000 to build a house, which can also buy peace of mind for my parents. After all, people like me who are about 30 years old and still single should be &quot;sentenced&quot; in the countryside, and some of my childhood playmates have children who can make soy sauce. For me, I value freedom more than money. I calculated that my consumption desire is actually not very high. My usual hobbies are basically reading, singing (hollering), playing games, and exercising. Sometimes I just stare and watch videos, and I rarely spend money. After comprehensive consideration, I finally chose to build it. Although I may not want to go back much in the future (if possible), in my opinion, this money does not greatly improve my life (after all, the desire for material things is like that), it is better to exchange it for &quot;worldly success&quot;, at least it can make my mother raise her head slightly at home, and it can also tell them in disguise that although I have not achieved much outside, I can still take care of myself and let me grow wildly. ps: I am going to quit my job naked at the end of the month, but I don&#x27;t plan to go home. I will stay in the rental house, play games, read books, pick up my old hobbies, and tinker with the long-dusty idea list. Let the bullets fly for a while. I have been working hard for many years, but I don&#x27;t know what for. After building this house (although it is still under construction, but it is expected to be completed in May or June this year), I can finally give an explanation to my family. In the future, I can seriously think about who I am, what I want to do, and what I can do.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾与楼主境况颇似，年近而立，于广州营生，老家亦为粤地四五线城市，亦常于岁末及国庆返乡（甚或若无必要，亦不甚欲归矣），存款亦近三十万，然无父母之资助，毕竟双亲并无厚禄，且家父早年染疾，积蓄几耗尽（即若欲建房，基本仅能仰仗己力）。稍有不同者，缘于吾处地不足，故与吾兄合建之，兄筑三层，吾筑两层，费用各自分担，包括楼层设计布局皆可分开。（然吾之选择为基本保持一致，除非有吾在意之处）故或许能省却些许。据彼辈估算，吾之两层整体费用约莫为二十五至三十万。去岁问及吾，吾之选择为建之（然每人情况不同，经历亦异，请审慎参考），吾之想法为耗费二十至三十万建房，亦可予父母买个心安，毕竟似吾此等年届而立仍孑然一身之人，于乡野皆当被&quot;判刑&quot;矣，且幼时玩伴已有稚童可打酱油者。于吾而言，较之钱财，吾更珍视自由。吾算及吾之消费物欲实则并不高，平日之爱好基本为读书、唱歌（吼两嗓子）、游戏、运动，有时发发呆看视频，鲜有耗费钱财者。综合衡量，最终选择营建。虽日后吾或亦不甚欲归焉（若可），然此等钱财于吾观来对吾生活之提升并不大（毕竟物欲如是），倒不如换作&quot;世俗之成功&quot;，至少可令家母于家中稍抬起头，亦可变相告知彼辈，吾虽于外未有大成，然尚能顾好自身，任吾野蛮生长便可。ps：准备月底裸辞矣，然亦未曾打算归家，而于出租屋蛰伏，游戏、读书，重拾昔日之爱好，捣腾尘封已久之idea列表，且让子弹飞一会儿。多年来一直在努力前进，不知以为何，筑完此房后（虽仍在营建中，然预计于今岁五六月便可入伙），可算对家中有个交代了，往后可认真思索一番吾乃何人，吾欲为甚，吾能为甚。</details></li><li>It all depends on whether you can go back to your hometown to work, but you are afraid of losing your job in big cities, so what can you do if you return to a small city?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此事全在君能否返乡谋生，然大城君皆惧失业，若返小城，君又能为甚？</details></li><li>I guess I can&#x27;t go back. I&#x27;m thinking that if I get laid off again, I&#x27;ll just find a job and live on. So I&#x27;m very纠结 now.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>恐难归矣，吾皆在思虑若再遭裁员，则随便寻一份营生苟活便了。故今甚纠结。</details></li><li>I really want to build a house in my hometown, but they won&#x27;t let me. I want to go back to the countryside when I&#x27;m old, mainly because the countryside is close to the city and the transportation is very convenient.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾亦甚想老家建房，然不予建啊，吾想老来归乡下，主因乡下离市区亦近，交通亦甚便利。</details></li><li>This money can be used to buy a commercial house with a good layout of more than 100 square meters in Zengcheng, Guangzhou, and the monthly supply is also very small.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此钱于广州增城或可购得户型尚可之一百多方商品房，月供亦甚少。</details></li><li>Currently, my parents live there. The main reason is that I am considering that the old house is cracked in some places due to the reconstruction of the neighboring houses. And the family members all suggested rebuilding, and also said that while the parents are still there, they can help with the process of building the house. If they are not there in the future, you will not know how to do it yourself.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>如今尊亲居于其中，主因虑及老宅缘于邻里重建宅邸，致使吾之房屋于某些地方出现裂痕焉。且家人们皆建议重建，还言趁尊亲尚在，营建宅邸之流程可助一臂之力，日后若不在，君自亦不会也。</details></li><li>In that case, what are you纠结 about? Are you worried that you won&#x27;t be allowed to rebuild in the future? Otherwise, you can wait until you really go back to build it. If you don&#x27;t go back, isn&#x27;t this money a waste?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>既如此，汝又纠结甚？莫非忧之后不予重建乎？否则汝待真归去再建啊，不归去此钱岂非纯属虚掷？</details></li><li>I also want to build one, but I am worried about my own financial problems, and the situation has not been good in the past two years, I feel that I may lose my job at any time.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾亦想建之，然忧虑自身经济问题，加之近两年之境况不佳，觉自身随时会失业焉。</details></li><li>It&#x27;s meaningless to empty your savings. But life will always get better. In this regard, in different eras, because the construction industry cannot provide a livelihood, the price of workers also affects the overall price. Building a house by yourself is a labor-intensive process. My family supervised the work most of the time back then, but the balcony may be sealed due to the position of the crane, and then tiles were laid, and then it changed from seeping to dripping. Some people look for relatives to supervise the work, but the sand is not washed with clean water, and then the paint is applied, and the outer walls are hung in the later stage. You are not at home, can your family handle the supervision? Building a house can take more than a year. In recent years, houses have been closely related to the number of people, and the number of floors has also changed. In fact, at the beginning, I had an idea to make the house structure into a rental house to make money. . . Of course, it didn&#x27;t do it in the end. With a brand new house, a brand new mood, it&#x27;s also different when others come to propose marriage.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>若掏空自身积蓄则毫无意义。然生活总会日渐美好，这般而言，不同年代缘于建筑行业无法提供营生，工人之价钱亦左右整体价。自建房乃一劳心劳力之过程，当年家人大部分时间皆监工焉，然阳台或缘于吊机莅临之位置，遂封合，又铺设瓷砖，然后从渗透变成滴水。别人家寻亲戚监工，结果沙子未用清水洗涤，然后皆刷漆焉，后期外墙面挂了。君不在家，家人能搞定监工么？营建一宅可是长达一年以上。这些年房屋皆与人口数量攸关甚多，层数亦有所变。其实伊始吾有个想法乃房型结构做成出租房赚钱的。。。当然最终亦未去做。有个崭新之房屋，崭新之心境，旁人来说亲亦有所不同也。</details></li><li>If your parents live in their hometown, you can rebuild it. My family is preparing to tear down and rebuild the old house that has been for more than 30 years this year. The building materials are cheaper than in the past few years, but the labor is getting more and more expensive.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>若尊亲于老家居住，可新建也。吾家今年准备将三十余年之老宅推倒重建，今之建材较之前几年廉价，唯人工日益高昂。</details></li><li>I am indeed a little afraid that I will not be allowed to rebuild in the future, because now to rebuild a house, you need the signature of the neighbors next door. If the neighbors do not sign, you will not be able to build it. In addition, there was a gap between me and the neighbors next door before, and now my father has finally managed to get the neighbors in the village to sign.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>确有少许畏惧之后不予重建也，因今重新建房，皆需隔壁邻居签名，若邻居不签名，汝亦无从建之，加之此前与隔壁邻居有所嫌隙，今家父好不容易才搞定让村里之邻居签名焉。</details></li><li>I dare not buy a house, the leverage is too big, and I will be extremely anxious if I lose my job.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>不敢购房，杠杆太大矣，一失业心神都要焦虑不堪。</details></li><li>If it is built now, my parents will be responsible for supervising the work.

In the final analysis, it is still a matter of my own economy, so I am still undecided...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>尊亲于老家安居，然此事确属倾家荡产矣，说到底还是自己之经济问题也，故吾至今仍踌躇不定...</details></li><li>If there is a need for living, you can build it, but you can build it smaller, and spend 200,000 to build a one-story house, do what you can.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>既有居住之需，则可建也，然可建小些，耗二十万建平层即可，量力而为。</details></li><li>These are not problems. If you don&#x27;t have enough money, just wait. Are you all in on an unnecessary self-built house in the countryside? As for the policy of homesteads, I tend to be more and more open. Your conditions, cash flow is very important, which means there are more choices.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此皆非问题，钱若不足，则再等等便是，汝今all in于一并无必要之农村自建房乎？至于宅基地之政策，吾倾向于愈发开放，汝之条件，现金流甚是重要，意寓着有更多选择。</details></li>
