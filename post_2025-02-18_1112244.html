                <li>Don&#x27;t listen to what netizens say. Go and see more houses yourself first, understand the house prices and planning of various areas, and then make plans. Do you really think netizens know a lot? 🐶 https://v2ex.com/t/694263<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>别听网友说的，自己先去多去看看房子，了解各个区域的房价和规划再做打算真以为网友很懂啊🐶 https://v2ex.com/t/694263</details></li><li>In 2015, people thought house prices would always rise. In 2025, people think house prices will always fall. The people who say the above two things are likely to be the same group of people.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>2015 年认为房价会永远涨。2025 年认为房价会永远跌。说上面两种话的，很可能是同一拨人。</details></li><li>If you want to buy, now is the time. If you don&#x27;t want to buy, it&#x27;s never the right time.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>想买就是现在。  不想买啥时候都不是时候</details></li><li>If it&#x27;s for your own living, buy when you need it.

If you have this ability, choose a few stocks to buy at their low points.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>普通人还想买到最低点？别做梦了，如果有这本事选择几个股票低点买入</details></li><li>Wait and see.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>再看看吧</details></li><li>In Chongqing, mortgage payments are now cheaper than rent in many places. Wait another year, and the rent is actually given to the landlord.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>重庆这边，不少地方现在房贷比租金都便宜了。多等一年，房租那是实打实的给房东送去了。</details></li><li>Around 2027-2028.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>27-28 年左右</details></li><li>If you look back at these kinds of posts, you&#x27;ll know that most people here don&#x27;t have the right judgment, and those who do are mostly lucky. The replies here are not very helpful, otherwise no one would lose money in the stock market.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你往前翻翻这类帖子，就知道这里大部分人都没啥正确的判断，有正确判断的也多是瞎猫碰上死耗子。这里的人回复没啥参考意义，否则股市就没人赔了。</details></li><li>You can buy if the price is within your affordability. Choose what you like and don&#x27;t compromise. Once you enter the market, don&#x27;t pay attention to the price, and focus on how to live comfortably.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>价格在自己能承受的范围内就能出手 选自己喜欢的 别将就 入场了就别关注价格 多关注关注怎么住得舒服些</details></li><li>Actually, it hasn&#x27;t fallen for long, but this place emphasizes speed.

Many houses with loans are now negative assets, and they will only get cheaper in the future, so you can bargain hard.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>刚需随时买，买了就别看价格了。现在很多有贷款的房子是负资产了，未来只会越来越便宜，可以大力的砍价。</details></li><li>When you have enough money on hand, if you have to empty 6 wallets, it doesn&#x27;t feel like the right time, considering the unemployment rate and employment rate.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>手头钱充裕的时候，如果硬要掏空 6 个钱包感觉什么时候都不合适，毕竟失业率和就业率摆在那儿</details></li><li>The prices of good second-hand houses and new houses are like this now.
