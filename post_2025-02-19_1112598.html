            <p># TL;DR

**Current Situation**: Limited options, mainly considering a Evergrande area. Housing quality and property management are questionable because the company went bankrupt and the government stepped in to ensure delivery. The underground garage is still under construction with undetermined completion date. A nearby area was delivered normally and is managed by Vanke Property.

**Area Comparison**:
- **Evergrande area**: Good environment, two artificial lakes, 150 meters between buildings, has seven-story villas.
- **Nearby area**: Average environment, cheaper price.

**Choice**: What would you choose? High-rise or villa in the Evergrande area, or high-rise in the nearby area?

# Detailed Version

## Background
My girlfriend and I met on a blind date on November 9, 2024. We are not engaged yet, but we have met each other&#x27;s parents. My family is from a rural area in City A, and her family is from an urban area in City B. The two cities are adjacent, 15 kilometers apart, about half an hour&#x27;s drive. The two families have argued many times over the issue of buying a house.

## Girlfriend&#x27;s Perspective
1. She has lived in the city since childhood, close to shopping malls, medical and education resources, and hopes to continue living in the city.
2. She is from a single-parent family and lives with her mother, and hopes to be closer to her mother and work (currently a 10-minute drive to work).
3. Requires a house area greater than 120 square meters.
4. Her mother said that if the pressure of buying a house is too great, the betrothal gifts can be appropriately reduced.
5. She is unwilling to marry if the requirements cannot be met.

**Note**: She is not good at driving, works as an unstaffed preschool teacher, does not contribute financially to buying or decorating the house, has 20,000 yuan in provident fund balance, and has a low contribution base.

## Boyfriend&#x27;s Perspective
1. The family&#x27;s financial situation is average, with a down payment budget of 600,000 yuan. The mother suggested buying a house around 1 million yuan in the rural area of City A, while the house prices in the urban area of City B are higher (13,000 yuan/square meter), and the cost of a 120-square-meter house plus decoration is too high.
2. As a resident of City A, he is reluctant to buy a house in City B, and the commute to work is longer (currently a 25-minute drive to work).
3. Understands her needs as a member of a single-parent family, but it is difficult to meet her high demands when her family does not contribute financially.

**Note**: Currently earns 8k per month after tax, has 10,000 yuan in provident fund balance, and has a low contribution base, possibly due to B City&#x27;s higher minimum wage.

## Previous Situation
He proposed breaking up, but she was unwilling and said that she was willing to lower her requirements and consider buying a house in City A near City B. However, my relatives and elders opposed this decision. Since she is the best candidate I have met in a year of blind dates, I am not considering breaking up at present.</p>

                <p>＃提炼心法

**现状**: 择地不多，唯恒大一处可堪入眼。然此地曾遭破产劫难，幸有官府出手，保其交付。楼宇质量难测，物业亦不精良。地库仍在开凿，交付之日未卜。邻近一处，同期建成，万科执掌，交付无虞。

**地势对比**: 
- **恒大**: 灵气尚可，有二人工湖，楼宇之间距百五十米，有七层小筑。
- **邻近小区**: 环境寻常，然价格稍逊。

**抉择**: 若是道友，将作何选？恒大高层、小筑，抑或邻近小区之高层？

# 详述因果

## 前缘
吾与道侣于二零二四年十一月九日相亲相识，尚未缔结婚契，然已拜见双方尊长。吾家乃甲市乡野，彼女家乃乙市坊间，两地相近，相距十五里，驱车半个时辰可达。然两家为置办洞府一事，屡有争执。

## 道侣之观点
1. 自幼居于城郭，与商市、医馆、学府近，望续居城池。
2. 单亲之家，与慈母同栖，望离慈母与供职之处近些（今驱车十分钟可至）。
3. 洞府需逾百二十平。
4. 彼女母亲表示，若购房压力甚重，则聘礼可酌情递减。
5. 若需求难遂，则不愿缔结婚契。

**备注**: 她之车技不佳，供职于幼稚园，无编制，于购房装修一事不资助，公积金余额两万，缴费基数较低。

## 吾之所思
1. 家境普通，首付预算六十万。吾母倡议于甲市乡野购百万元左右之洞府，然乙市城池房价颇高（毛坯每平一万三），百二十平之洞府，加之装修费用，则过于高昂。
2. 吾乃甲市之人，购乙市洞府，意有不愿，且供职之路程更远（今驱车二刻钟可达）。
3. 知彼女单亲之家之所需，然彼女家不资助，而要求甚多，实难满足。

**备注**: 今之月薪八千，公积金余额一万，缴费基数较低，或因乙市最低薪俸较高之故。

## 以往之事
曾提出分手，然彼女不愿，并表示愿降低要求，考虑购于近乙市之甲市房屋。然吾之亲族长辈皆反对。因相亲一年以来，彼女乃吾所遇条件较佳者，故暂不考虑分手。</p>

                <li>Unstaffed preschool teacher, doesn&#x27;t contribute a dime to buying a house, and needs to buy a 120+ square meter house in her city, where does she get the courage?

Never let the small head command the big head. You are buying a house and getting married after only knowing each other for 3 months. You may not know your &quot;girlfriend&quot;&#x27;s personality. Why don&#x27;t you spend another half year/year getting to know each other better before making a decision? Single parent, preschool teacher, unemployed, lives paycheck to paycheck, fangirl, chubby, older than you, salary 8K? I don&#x27;t know what OP&#x27;s conditions are, but your girlfriend&#x27;s conditions are below average. If she has a younger sibling, it might be even worse. Never let the small head command the big head! Never let the small head command the big head!

According to the preconditions you described, you two are not suitable to be together.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>君今之要务，非择何处购房，乃决是否与此人缔结婚契。依君所描述之前置条件，尔等并不适宜共结连理。</details></li><li>I have read the suggestions mentioned by everyone. I went to her house tonight and showed them to her. I also explained and persuaded some V2ers&#x27; sharp words to prevent her from getting angry. Later I asked her how much she could save per month in the future. As a result, she ignored me. I asked again, she said she didn&#x27;t know. Then I got angry, waited patiently for five minutes, and asked again. She just scrolled through Xiaohongshu and ignored me, so I left. After I got home, we had a big fight on WeChat. She said she was angry that I put these things on V2. I said we are both in the game, and outsiders can see it more clearly. Finally, she answered my question. She really didn&#x27;t know. I was very angry and said that we agreed to pay the loan together in the future, but you can&#x27;t even tell me the basic monthly savings. Am I going to pay it alone? Later we broke up. She said she would change and was willing to live a hard life. I knew that she, who had grown up in the city and was spoiled, would not be so easy to change. Alas, I thought we would definitely get married this year or next year. I talked to my friends. My friends thought that my mentality was more anxious than girls of her age and advised me to take things slowly when it comes to marriage. People who go on blind dates need to get to know each other well. Even if they get engaged, they may not get married. They said I was too naive. This post is finished. I hope everyone meets normal people on blind dates and steadily moves towards a happy marriage.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>诸位之谏，吾已阅之。今夜至其家，亦示之。有言辞激烈者，吾亦解说劝导，以防其怒。后问其日后每月可存几何。然其未理。吾再问，其曰不知。吾怒，耐心等候五分钟，再问。其只刷小红书，未理吾，吾遂离去。归家后，微信大吵一架。其言其怒吾于V2之上示事。吾言吾侪皆局中人，局外人看得清楚些。终，其答吾问。其真不知。吾甚怒，言约日后共还贷款，汝连基本月存皆言不出。吾岂要一人偿还？后，撕破面皮。言能改，愿过苦日子。吾知其娇生惯养，非易事耳。唉，本以为今岁明岁必可缔结婚姻。与友聊之，友觉吾之心态较其同龄女子更急，谏之结婚之事须缓。相亲之人须好生接触。纵订婚亦或不婚。言吾甚幼稚。此贴告终。愿诸位相亲遇常人，稳步走向幸福婚姻。</details></li><li>&quot;But when it comes to marriage, I am willing to compromise. I am afraid that if I lose this one, I don&#x27;t know when I will have the next one. Blind dates are too painful.&quot; Love cannot be compromised, and neither can marriage. Marriage is a lifelong matter. Do you think you can endure it for so long? (PS: If you think divorce is casual, then pretend I didn&#x27;t say anything) You have only known each other for more than 4 months since you met. Since there is disagreement, then spend more time with each other.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>“然婚姻嘛，吾愿将就。恐失此一，不知何时再遇良缘。相亲之苦不堪言。” 感情不可将就，婚姻更是如此。婚姻乃终身大事。君自忖可忍受如此之久乎？（若觉离婚乃寻常事，则当我未言。）尔等相识至今仅四月有余。既有异议，则当多多相处。</details></li><li>Only knew each other for 3 months, and the two families have been arguing many times over the issue of houses, which is the issue of money. Then after you earn 8k per month and carry a loan of 700,000, do you think you can live as you said &#x27;almost there&#x27;? This is without considering the possible risks such as the need to decorate the wedding gifts and the possibility of the house depreciating and the job being unstable.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>相识仅三月，两家便为房屋之事，亦即钱财之事，屡有争执。则君日后月俸八千，身负七十万之贷，自忖可如君所言“差不多得了”乎？此未计及装修聘礼之费，以及房屋贬值，工作不稳等可能之风险。</details></li><li>I also feel that OP is too anxious. I have been dating my girlfriend for several years, and even so, when dealing with some big things, I still find that she has some personalities and details that I didn&#x27;t notice before. So I think in such a short time, what you see may not be the real her. The stage of allocating things and property before marriage itself requires a game. Don&#x27;t take it for granted that you are generous and the other party will be generous. And OP&#x27;s own income is not very high, the other party&#x27;s family has no support, coupled with a high-spending object, your life pressure will be very great in the future. The girl is saying that she will reduce her consumption level, but you should consider why she had such a high consumption level before, didn&#x27;t she ever think about saving a little bit? Many girls with not-so-good family conditions around me earn money to save money early and accumulate their own vaults. I have always believed that high-spending men or women who live paycheck to paycheck must have thick family backgrounds to be understood. And she is now starting to save money for the future, to put it bluntly, is to reduce her own quality of life, and later she will be wronged by anything, and will feel that marriage makes herself live more bitterly. It is recommended to spend more time together. 29 years old is not too old for boys.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾亦觉君甚为急躁。吾与女友交往数年矣，即便如此，于处理大事之时，吾仍发觉其有昔日未曾留意之性情与细节，故吾以为于如此短之时日内，君所见未必乃真实现其。婚前之物事与财产分配，本身便需博弈。勿以为君之慷慨，彼亦会慷慨。且君之收入实不高，彼家无所助，加之高消费之对象，君日后之生活压力必大。女方曰欲降低其消费水平，然君宜思之，何故其先有如斯之高消费水平乎？岂从未想著存些银两乎？吾身边诸多家境并不甚好之女子，皆是赚钱便早早存之，累积己之金库。吾一直认为高消费之月光族，必家境殷实方可理解。且其今始为日后省钱，直白说来乃是降低其己身之生活质量，日后稍有不如意，皆会觉委屈，且会觉婚姻使其生活更苦。建议多加相处，男子二十九正值壮年。</details></li><li>@zj27 #8 Believe me, buying a house, getting married, and betrothal gifts, these 3 things are the biggest test for the woman (including the woman&#x27;s family) at present. Don&#x27;t use a single mindset: spend money to save trouble, unless your financial resources are sufficient, otherwise there will be endless family conflicts later. Suggestions: 1. Consider which place is better for both parties to find jobs/raise children/shop/educate/transport, and then determine the priority of buying a house. 2. Since you pay for the house, the default title deed is written in your name, please be sure to make it clear. If you do not agree, please consider whether to reduce wedding expenses/wedding gifts to avoid early difficulties. &#x27;3. Please provide the basis for why the area must be greater than 120 square meters. Do not directly prevaricate with the sentence: a family cannot live in less than 120 square meters. Please combine your actual needs, and don&#x27;t let the other party&#x27;s face-saving drive crazy leverage for themselves. (Normally, three bedrooms, one living room, two bathrooms, one kitchen and one balcony are enough for a family of 3 to live in, the building area is about 104, and the actual area is about 85) 4. If the requirements cannot be met, she is unwilling to marry. --Please remember that marriage is a matter for two people, don&#x27;t let you be busy with everything while she only cares about making conditions. If this happens, please consider breaking up, I&#x27;m not kidding.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@zj27 #8 信吾，购房、成婚、聘礼，此三件事，乃当下女方（包括女方家庭）对汝之最大考验。切忌单一思维：花钱以求省事，除非汝财力足够，否则后续家内矛盾将无穷无尽。建议：一、考量双方于何地就业/育儿/购物/教育/交通更佳，再定购处之优先次序。二、既购房乃汝出资，则默认产权证书填写汝名，请务必明晰此事，若不同意，请酌情删减婚礼/聘礼开支，以免前期艰难。三、面积务必大于百二十平方之依据，请对方给出，勿以一句：小于百二十平方一家人不堪居住而搪塞之。请合吾侪实际需求，勿使对方顾全面子而疯狂增其杠杆。（常言之三室一厅二卫一厨一阳台，足矣三口之家居住，建筑面积约百零四，实际面积约八十五左右）四、若要求无法满足，则彼女不愿成婚。-- 请谨记，婚姻乃二人之事，莫让汝一人忙前忙后，而彼只管提条件，若见此景，请考虑分手，吾非戏言。</details></li><li>@weenhall5 Your idea is the same as my mother&#x27;s, it&#x27;s a bit self-centered and too much from an interest perspective.

It doesn&#x27;t seem too outrageous, and she also has the willingness to negotiate and compromise, so it won&#x27;t immediately lead to a breakup. Now the problem, on the surface, is the choice of the area, but in fact it is the competition between the two families. The core is still between the two of you. If you really hit it off, there are many people who have bare marriages; conversely, if you two don&#x27;t have any feelings, just follow the process and don&#x27;t be troubled or uncomfortable. Just be a messenger. Of course, you can also use this external pressure to twist you two into a rope. You two make decisions together, and then settle your respective families. The people in the marriage are the most important. Evaluate the other person&#x27;s character, thinking, and behavior, and it is you two who will live together in the future, not the mothers of you two.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@zj27吾阅汝之后续答复，言聘礼仅乃一过场而已。对方之要求仅余：购房（面积百二十，离原所住地址近些）。观之不太离谱，亦有商榷妥协之意愿，不至于立即走向分手之境端。今之难题，表面乃小区之选择，实则乃男女两家之角力，核心仍在汝二人身。真若情投意合，亦有裸婚者；反之若汝二人并无感觉，则循例行事即可。何必纠结难受，只作传声筒罢了。当然亦可凭借此种外部压力，将汝二人拧成一股绳。尔等一同拿主意，然后摆平各自家人，婚姻中人最为重要，多评估对方品德、思维、待人接物。往后乃尔等二人共度日子，而并非尔等二人之母亲一同过活。</details></li><li>&quot;Mother suggested buying a house for about 1 million yuan in the rural area of ​​City A&quot; I don&#x27;t know about anything else, but this must be rejected. When you buy a house, you must consider whether there is anyone to take over. There will be fewer and fewer people in the countryside in the future. If you want to sell it, who will take over? Furthermore, you must also consider resource issues when buying a house, such as schooling, medical care, police presence, and job opportunities. The most fundamental thing is: buy where there are more resources, because there is a greater possibility of someone taking over.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>“母亲建议于甲市农村购百万元左右之房” 其余不知，然此事务必拒绝。汝置房时必考量接盘者是否存在。日后乡村之人只会日渐减少，汝若欲脱手，谁来接盘？再说，汝亦务必考量资源问题，如入学、医疗、出警、工作机会。根本之理乃购于资源聚集之处，彼地更易于寻得接盘之人</details></li><li>Only knew each other for a few months, and you are already so anxious.

Based on the information already given by OP, my personal judgment is to stop the loss in time and break up as soon as possible. Since you are not listening to persuasion, then I suggest talking for at least 1 year to get to know each other better.
