            <p># Summary Version

**Current Situation**: There are not many optional residential areas currently. The main consideration is a Evergrande residential area. This residential area was delivered by the government to ensure the delivery of buildings due to previous bankruptcy. The quality is questionable, and the property management is not very good. The underground garage is still under construction, and the delivery time is uncertain. Next door is a contemporary residential area, normally delivered, managed by Vanke Property.

**Residential Area Comparison**:
- **Evergrande Residential Area**: Better environment, with two artificial lakes, a building spacing of 150 meters, and seven-story bungalows.
- **Next Door Residential Area**: General environment, cheaper house prices.

**Choice**: How would everyone choose? The high-rise, bungalows of Evergrande residential area, or the high-rise of the next door residential area?

# Detailed Version

## Background Introduction
My partner and I met on a blind date on November 9, 2024. We are not yet engaged, but we have met the parents. My family is in a rural area of City A, and her family is in the urban area of City B. The two places are adjacent, 15 kilometers apart, and about half an hour&#x27;s drive. The two families have repeatedly argued over the issue of buying a house.

## Female&#x27;s perspective
1. She has lived in the city since she was a child, close to shopping malls, medical care and education resources, and hopes to continue living in the city.
2. She is from a single-parent family and lives with her mother. She hopes to be closer to her mother and workplace (currently a 10-minute drive to work).
3. The required house area is greater than 120 square meters.
4. Her mother said that if the pressure of buying a house is high, the bride price can be reduced appropriately.
5. If the requirements cannot be met, she is unwilling to marry.

**Note**: She has poor driving skills and is an unestablished kindergarten teacher. She does not pay for buying a house or decoration. The balance of the housing provident fund is 20,000, and the payment base is low.

## Male&#x27;s perspective
1. The family conditions are average, and the down payment budget is 600,000. The mother suggested buying a house of about 1 million in the rural area of City A, while the house price in the urban area of City B is higher (the unit price of the rough house is 13,000/square meter), and a 120 square meter house plus decoration costs are too high.
2. As a person from City A, I am not very willing to buy a house in City B, and the commuting time to work is longer (currently a 25-minute drive to the company).
3. I understand the needs of her single-parent family, but it is difficult to meet the high requirements without her family paying.

**Note**: The current monthly salary is 8k, the balance of the housing provident fund is 10,000, and the payment base is low, which may be due to the higher minimum wage in City B.

## Previous situation
I once proposed to break up, but she was unwilling, and said that she was willing to lower the requirements and consider buying a house in City A near City B. However, my relatives and elders opposed this decision. Since she is the best condition object I have encountered in a year of blind dates, I am not considering breaking up at present.</p>

                <p># 省流版

**现状**: 目前可选的小区不多，主要考虑的是一个恒大小区。该小区因之前破产，由政府保交楼交付，质量存疑，物业也不太好。目前地下车库仍在施工，交付时间未定。隔壁是一个同期小区，正常交付，由万科物业管理。

**小区对比**:
- **恒大小区**: 环境较好，有两个人工湖，楼间距 150 米，有七层小洋房。
- **隔壁小区**: 环境一般，房价较便宜。

**选择**: 大家会怎么选？恒大小区的高层、小洋房，还是隔壁小区的高层？

# 详细版

## 背景介绍
我和对象于 2024 年 11 月 9 日相亲认识，目前尚未订婚，但已见过家长。我家在 A 市农村，她家在 B 市城区，两地相邻，距离 15 公里，车程约半小时。两家人因买房问题多次争吵。

## 女方观点
1. 她从小生活在市区，离商场、医疗和教育资源较近，希望继续住在市区。
2. 她是单亲家庭，与母亲同住，希望离母亲和工作单位近一些（目前开车 10 分钟到单位）。
3. 对房子面积要求大于 120 平方米。
4. 她母亲表示，如果买房压力大，彩礼可以适当减少。
5. 如果要求无法满足，她不愿意结婚。

**备注**: 她开车技术不佳，职业为无编制幼师，买房和装修不出钱，公积金余额 2 万，缴费基数较低。

## 男方观点
1. 家庭条件一般，首付预算 60 万。母亲建议在 A 市农村购买 100 万左右的房子，而 B 市城区房价较高（毛坯单价 1.3 万/平方米），120 平方米的房子加上装修费用过高。
2. 作为 A 市人，购买 B 市房子不太乐意，且上班通勤时间更长（目前开车 25 分钟到公司）。
3. 理解她单亲家庭的需求，但她家不出钱，要求又高，难以满足。

**备注**: 目前月薪到手 8k ，公积金余额 1 万，缴费基数较低，可能是 B 市最低工资较高的原因。

## 之前的情况
曾提出分手，但她不愿意，并表示愿意降低要求，考虑购买靠近 B 市的 A 市房子。然而，我的亲戚长辈都反对这一决定。由于相亲一年来她是我遇到的条件较好的对象，目前不考虑分手。</p>

                <li>An unestablished kindergarten teacher, not paying a dime for the house, and still having to buy a 120+ square meter house in her city, where does she get the courage? And she is still a single parent, why does she need such a big house?

Don&#x27;t let your little head lead your big head. You&#x27;ve only known each other for 3 months and you want to buy a house and get married. You probably don&#x27;t know your &quot;girlfriend&#x27;s&quot; personality. Why don&#x27;t you spend another half a year/year to understand her better? Single parent, kindergarten teacher, unestablished, moonlight clan, star chasing, fat, older than you, salary 8K? I don&#x27;t know what UP&#x27;s conditions are, but based on your girlfriend&#x27;s current conditions, she shouldn&#x27;t reach the standard of ordinary people. If you add a younger sibling, it may be even worse. Don&#x27;t let your little head lead your big head! Don&#x27;t let your little head lead your big head! Don&#x27;t let your little head lead your big head!<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@zj27 #24看完更多的信息，感觉 up 有点上头了。千万不要小头指挥大头。这才认识 3 个月就要买房，要结婚。你很有可能不知道你“女朋友”的性格。要不你再处半年/一年，多了解了解再说？单亲，幼师，无编，月光族，追星，胖，比你年纪大，工资 8K ？不知道 UP 条件如何，就现在你女朋友的这些条件，应该达不到普通人水准。要是再加个弟妹，那可能更惨。千万不要小头指挥大头！千万不要小头指挥大头！千万不要小头指挥大头！</details></li><li>The main problem you need to solve now is not which community to buy a house in, but whether or not to marry this person. Based on the preconditions you described, you two are not suitable to be together.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你现在更重点要解决的问题不是要买哪个小区的房子而是要不要和这个人结婚按照你描述的前置条件你们两个并不适合结合在一起</details></li><li>I have read all the suggestions mentioned. I went to her house tonight and showed them to her. I also explained and persuaded some v2ers who were using strong language to prevent her from getting angry. Later, I asked her how much she could save each month in the future. As a result, she ignored me. I asked again, and she said she didn&#x27;t know. Then I got very angry, waited patiently for five minutes, and asked again. She only browsed Xiaohongshu and ignored me, so I left. After returning home, we had a big fight on WeChat. She said she was angry and blamed me for putting these things on v2. I said we are all involved, and outsiders can see more clearly. In the end, she answered my question. She really didn&#x27;t know. I was very angry. We agreed to pay off the loan together in the future, but you can&#x27;t even tell me the basic monthly savings. Does this mean I have to pay it off alone? Later we fell out. We agreed that she would change and be willing to live a hard life. I knew that she, who grew up pampered in the city, would not be so easy to change. Alas, I thought we would definitely get married this year or next year. I talked to my friends, and they thought my mentality was more anxious than girls of her age. They advised me to take things slowly about marriage, that people who go on blind dates need to get to know each other well, and that even engagement may not lead to marriage. They said I was too naive. This post ends here. I hope everyone who goes on blind dates meets normal people and steadily moves towards a happy marriage.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>各位提到的建议我都看了，今晚去了她家还给她也看了，有些 v2er 言辞激烈的我也做了解释劝导，防止她生气，后面问了一下她以后月存款大概能有多少，结果她不理我，我再问，她说不知道，然后我很生气，耐心等待了五分钟，再问一遍，她只刷小红书，不理我，我就走了，到家后微信又大吵一架，她说她在生气，怪我把这些事情放在 v2 上了，我说我们都是局中人，局外人看得清楚一点，最后回答了我的问题，她确实是不知道，我就很愤怒，说好的以后一起还贷款，你连基本的月存款都说不出来，这是让我一个人还吗，后面撕破脸了，说好的会改，肯过苦日子，我就知道她这个城里宠大的不是那么轻易好改的，唉，本来以为今年明年肯定可以结婚了，跟朋友聊了聊，朋友觉得我心态比她同年龄的女生还着急，劝我结婚的事情要慢慢来，相亲的人需要好好接触，哪怕订婚也可能不结婚，说我太幼稚，本贴终结，愿大家相亲遇到正常人，稳步走向幸福婚姻</details></li><li>&quot;But when it comes to marriage, I am willing to compromise because I am afraid of losing this one. I don&#x27;t know when the next one will come. Blind dates are too miserable.&quot; You can&#x27;t compromise on feelings, and even more so on marriage. Marriage is a lifelong matter. Do you think you can endure it for so long? (PS: If you think divorce is casual, then ignore what I said) You have only known each other for more than 4 months since you met today. Since you don&#x27;t agree, then spend more time together.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>&quot;但是结婚嘛，我是愿意将就的，我就怕这个没了，下一个不知道要等到猴年马月，相亲太遭罪了&quot;感情不能将就，婚姻更是如此。结婚是一辈子的事情，你觉得你可以一直忍受这么久嘛？(PS:觉得离婚随便的当我没说)你们从认识到今天才 4 个多月，既然意见不统一，那就再相处相处。</details></li><li>You&#x27;ve only known each other for 3 months, and the two families have repeatedly argued over the issue of the house, which is a matter of money. So later, with a monthly salary of 8k and a loan of 700,000, do you think you can &quot;get by&quot; as you said? This doesn&#x27;t even include the cost of decoration, wedding gifts, and the risk of the house depreciating and unstable work that may occur in the future.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>才认识 3 个月，因为房子也就是钱的问题，两家人能多次争吵，那么之后你月薪 8k 背 70 万贷款，你认为你们能按你说的“差不多得了”吗，这还是没算你将来还需要装修结婚彩礼花钱呢，以及房子贬值工作不稳定等可能发生的风险。</details></li><li>I also feel that OP is too anxious. I have been dating my partner for several years, and even so, when dealing with some major issues, I still find that she has some personality and behavior details that I have not noticed before. So I think in such a short time, what you see is not necessarily the real her. The stage of purchasing things and distributing property before marriage itself requires a game. Don&#x27;t take it for granted that if you are generous, the other person will be generous. Moreover, OP&#x27;s income is not very high, and the other party&#x27;s family has no support, plus a high-spending partner, your life pressure will be very high in the future. The girl said that she will reduce her consumption level, but you should consider why she had such a high consumption level before. Didn&#x27;t she think about saving some money? Many girls around me who don&#x27;t have very good family conditions save money as soon as they earn money to accumulate their own treasury. I have always believed that boys or girls with high consumption until moonlight must have a solid family background to be understood. Moreover, she is now starting to save money for the future, which in plain terms is to reduce her own quality of life. If there is any dissatisfaction in the future, she will feel wronged and feel that marriage makes her life more bitter. It is recommended to spend more time together. 29 years old is not too old for boys.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我也感觉 op 太急了，我和我对象谈了好几年了，即使这样在处理一些大事情的时候我还是会发现她有一些性格和处事细节是我之前没察觉到的，所以我觉得这么短的时间，你看的她不一定是真实的她。在婚前购置东西财产分配这个阶段本身就是需要博弈的，不要想当然的认为自己大度对方就会大度。而且 op 本身收入并不算高，对方家庭毫无支持，加上一个高消费的对象，以后你的生活压力会很大的，女生是说会降低自己的消费水平，但是你应该考虑为什么她之前会有那么高的消费水平，难道没想过存一点吗？我身边很多家庭条件没那么好的女生都是赚钱就早早的存钱，积攒自己的金库。我一直认为高消费到月光的男生或女生必须是家底子厚才可以理解的。而且她现在开始为了以后省钱，说白了是降低她自己的生活质量，后续有任何不如意她都会委屈，会觉得结婚让自己活得更苦了。建议再多多相处，29 岁对于男生不算年纪大的。</details></li><li>@zj27 #8 Trust me, buying a house, getting married, and the bride price, these 3 things are the biggest test for the woman (including the woman&#x27;s family) at present. Don&#x27;t have a single way of thinking: spending money to save trouble, unless your financial resources are sufficient, otherwise there will be endless family conflicts later. Suggestion: 1. Consider where both parties&#x27; jobs are better for employment/childcare/shopping/education/transportation, and then determine the priority of the house purchase location. 2. Since you are paying for the house, the house ownership certificate is written in your name by default. Please be sure to make it clear. If you do not agree, please consider reducing the wedding expenses and the bride price to avoid early difficulties. ‘3. Please provide the basis for why the area must be greater than 120 square meters. Don&#x27;t just brush it off with a sentence: a family cannot live in less than 120 square meters. Please combine your actual needs, and don&#x27;t let the other party be so obsessed with saving face that you crazily put leverage on yourself. (Normally, a three-bedroom apartment with two bathrooms, a kitchen and a balcony is enough for a family of 3 to live in. The building area is about 104, and the actual area is about 85.) 4. If the requirements cannot be met, she is unwilling to marry. --Please remember that marriage is a matter for two people. Don&#x27;t let you be busy with everything while she only makes conditions. If this happens, please consider breaking up. I&#x27;m not kidding.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@zj27 #8 相信我，买房、结婚、彩礼，这 3 件事，就是目前女方（包括女方家庭）对你的最大考验，不要单一思维：花钱买省事，除非你的财力足够，否则后面就是无休止的家庭矛盾。建议： 1 、考虑下双方工作在哪里更好就业/育儿/购物/教育/交通，再确定买房地点优先级。   2 、既然买房是你出钱，默认房本写你的名字，请务必明明白白说清楚，如不同意，请斟酌是否要从结婚开销、彩礼上削减，避免前期艰难。  ‘3 、面积必须大于 120 平方米的依据请对方给出，不要一句：小于 120 平方米住不了一家人直接搪塞过去。请结合你们实际需求，不要让对方一句好面子，疯狂给自己上杠杆。（正常来说三室一厅两卫一厨一阳台，足够 3 口之家居住，建面大概 104,实得大概 85 左右）4 、如果要求无法满足，她不愿意结婚。 --请记住，结婚是两个人的事，不要你一个人忙前忙后，而她只管提条件，如果出现这种情况，请考虑分手，不开玩笑。</details></li><li>@weenhall5 Your idea is the same as my mother&#x27;s, that is, it is a bit self-centered and too profit-oriented.

It doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s too outrageous, and there is willingness to discuss and compromise, so it shouldn&#x27;t lead to a breakup immediately. The problem now is, on the surface, the choice of the community, but in reality, it is a contest between the two families, and the core is still in the two of you. If you really like each other, there are many people who have naked marriages; on the other hand, if you two don&#x27;t have any feelings for each other, just follow the process and don&#x27;t be entangled and uncomfortable, just be a mouthpiece. Of course, you can also use this external pressure to twist the two of you into a rope. You make decisions together and then deal with your respective families. People are still the most important thing in marriage. Evaluate the other party&#x27;s character, thinking, and way of dealing with people. You will be the ones living the life in the future, not your mothers.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@zj27 我看了你后面的回复说彩礼只是走个形式，对方要求只剩下：买房（面积 120 、距离原住址近一些）。看起来不是过分离谱，也有商量妥协的意愿，不至于马上走到分手的阶段。现在的问题，表面上是小区的选择，实际上男女两家的角力，核心的还在你们两个人身上。真要是那种看对眼的，裸婚的也很多；反过来如果你们俩没啥感觉，就按流程走，别纠结难受，纯当个传声筒得了。当然，也可以借着这种外部压力，把你们两个人拧成一股绳，你们一起拿主意，然后摆平各自家里人，婚姻里人还是最重要的，多评估一下对方品德、思维、待人接物，以后是你俩过日子，不是你俩的母亲过日子。</details></li><li>&quot;Mother suggested buying a house of about 1 million in the rural area of City A.&quot; I don&#x27;t know anything else, but this must be rejected. When you buy a house, you must consider whether there is someone to take over. The rural population will be decreasing in the future. If you want to sell, who will take over? Besides, you must also consider the issue of resources when buying a house. Schooling, medical care, police, and job opportunities must be considered. The most fundamental thing is: buy where there are many resources, because there is a greater possibility of someone taking over.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>&quot;母亲建议在 A 市农村购买 100 万左右的房子&quot;别的不知道，但是这个一定要拒绝。你买房的时候必须要考虑接盘有没有人，以后农村是人越来越少的，如果要出手，谁来接盘？再说，你买房也要考虑资源问题啊，上学、医疗、出警、工作机会这是必须要考虑到啊，最根本的就是：哪里资源多多就在哪里买，因为存在接盘人的可能性更大</details></li><li>They&#x27;ve only known each other for a few months and are already so anxious. It&#x27;s obvious that the little head is leading the big head. Several people upstairs have been advising, but OP doesn&#x27;t listen at all. Then I&#x27;ll say one more thing, I think you should continue dating for at least 1 year. You can&#x27;t see anything in 3 months of getting along. Based on the information OP has already provided, my personal judgment is that you should stop the loss in time and break up as soon as possible. Since you don&#x27;t listen to advice, then I suggest you spend at least 1 year dating and get to know each other better. If you still don&#x27;t listen to advice and just keep being hotheaded, then there&#x27;s really nothing I can do.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>这才认识几个月，就着急成这样，很明显是小头指挥大头了。楼上好几位都在劝，OP 压根就不听。那我再多嘴一句，我觉得，继续谈个 1 年起，3 个月相处时间根本看不出来什么，根据 OP 已经给出的信息，我个人的判断的话，及时止损，早日分手最好。既然不听劝，那就建议多谈个 1 年起，再相处相处多了解下，如果这也不听劝光一个劲上头，那真没办法了。</details></li><li>@zj27 #24 I originally thought there was nothing to advise on this kind of housekeeping, but after reading the replies in this thread, I can only say: OP, run away...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@zj27 #24 本来觉得这种家务事没啥好劝的，但是看了这楼回复只能说：OP ，快逃……</details></li>
