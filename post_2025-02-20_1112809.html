                <li>@asdhak Dude, you can&#x27;t live just for the last 20 years of your life. It&#x27;s not worth it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@asdhak 哥们，人总不能只为人生的后 20 年活着，真不至于。</details></li><li>@skyrim61 #1 To put it simply, don&#x27;t buy a house, don&#x27;t buy a car, don&#x27;t get married, don&#x27;t have children, have low consumption, and start saving money for retirement after graduation.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@skyrim61 #1 通俗点，不买房，不买车，不结婚，不生子，低消费，毕业就开始存钱养老</details></li><li>Low consumption, low desire, high savings, can break the cycle.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>低消费, 低欲望, 高储蓄, 可破</details></li><li>@yueyuea If you think your point of view is persuasive, then provide more arguments to prove it, instead of using words like &quot;it looks like giving you leverage you can lift the whole earth&quot; to sarcastically attack the other person.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@yueyuea 如果你认为你的观点有说服力，那就拿出更多论点来论证，而不是用“看起来给你一个支点你可以翘起整个地球”这种话来阴阳对方</details></li><li>In fact, any problem in life can be solved in the end. Even if you are unemployed without any preparation, there will be various new opportunities coming your way.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>其实人生任何问题最终都能解决的，就算最后啥也没准备失业了，也会有各种各样新机会来找你的</details></li><li>On the one hand, don&#x27;t spend money indiscriminately, on the other hand, improve your own competitiveness.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>一方面不乱花钱,一方面提升自身竞争力</details></li><li>What if you are unemployed?

There is a popular saying on the Internet now, that life is only 30,000 days, and it may not need to have any meaning. It has received a lot of likes. You also know that life is only 30,000 days. You are willing to pursue some meaning, but a large part of people are unwilling to pursue your so-called meaning. Everyone just needs to live their own lives well.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@yueyuea 但是人生的意义总不能只是为了 ‘去码头整点薯条’ 而存在...网上现在有句话很流行，就是人生短短三万天，可能并不需要有什么意义，获得了非常多人的点赞，你也知道人生短短三万天，你愿意追求某些意义，可就是有很大一部分人不愿意追求你所谓的意义，大家只要各自活好各自的就行</details></li><li>I just had my 46th birthday this month, embedded software development, located in Shenzhen, I have a house, a car, and a son.
