        <div class="content">
            <p>A friend, a female born in &#x27;98, graduated from a 211 university.
Currently working in the technology department of a bank. The work intensity is moderate, requiring overtime, but the pressure isn&#x27;t high. Overtime is due to the atmosphere. My friend has some technological pursuits, but everyone knows the technology in banks. Although new technologies exist, there are more old things. The current total compensation is around 300,000, but since she&#x27;s always been a peripheral and insignificant figure, the work assigned isn&#x27;t very important, leading to consistently poor performance reviews. This year, her salary was even reduced by 10,000. If she gets another poor review this year, she&#x27;ll be optimized out. This has significantly impacted her mood. Furthermore, my friend mentioned being unsuited to the workplace atmosphere in the bank, such as needing to actively promote oneself and claim credit. Therefore, she&#x27;s considering seeking a better opportunity.
My friend interviewed for an outsourcing position at a major internet company, which could increase her current income by 30% and involve more technology-related work rather than management-heavy work like in the bank. So, she&#x27;s very tempted and plans to resign without a new job lined up, prepare for a while, and look for a better place.
I advised her against it, thinking it&#x27;s better to look for a job while still employed. However, my friend wants to pursue her ideals, so I didn&#x27;t advise further. What do you think, Yuanfang?</p>

A few months of savings shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, especially for people who haven&#x27;t changed jobs in years. Their perception of the overall market environment might still be from years ago, thinking they can easily change jobs and get a raise. The biggest problem with resigning without a job lined up is: rashly cutting off your own escape route! These people initially spend the first month playing, then in the second month, they start submitting resumes and find few replies. In the third month, they start to panic and submit resumes everywhere, and then they have to accept a non-permanent, lower-paying, overtime-heavy, long-commute job. If you don&#x27;t have money, you have to. If you have money, even a six-month gap is tough.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>裸辞之弊，非止于财。数月积蓄当非难事，然久未更事者，或滞于往昔之认知，以为易觅高枝。殊不知贸然断后路，首月安逸，次月投履寥寥，三月则焦虑海投，终受降薪加班之苦。若无财力支撑，半年空窗亦是煎熬。</details></li><li>@SupperHobby #22 Has a boyfriend, what&#x27;s it to you?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@SupperHobby #22 既有良人相伴，与汝何干？</details></li><li>I wanted to resign from a certain aerospace research institute in 2020, but I didn&#x27;t after listening to my dad&#x27;s advice. In the end, I endured it for another year and resigned at the end of 2021. The main reason had nothing to do with income, but was a combination of work content, technological development, interpersonal relationships, etc. In short, during my time at that unit, I experienced continuous hair loss, insomnia, and emotional depression. I left in November, played until after the Lunar New Year, paid for my own social security during this time, and started looking for a job around February. I joined a new company in March, and my total compensation increased by about a quarter. The biggest difference is that my mood improved a lot, and my appetite improved. One thing no one mentioned above is that because the market is declining, it&#x27;s better to leave sooner rather than later. Even if it&#x27;s hard to find a job now, it&#x27;s not impossible. If you get optimized out in a few years, wouldn&#x27;t it be even harder to find a job? The original poster&#x27;s friend is at risk of being optimized out, and it looks like a significant risk. Of course, regardless of whether I listened to the advice or not, I knew that I was ultimately responsible. At the time, I decided to endure it for a year to see if there would be a turnaround at the institute. But sometimes I also feel that if I could have seen the situation more clearly at the time and had the courage to reason with my family, wouldn&#x27;t it have been better to resign in 2020, avoid that year of suffering, and waste a year of time? Moreover, the job market was better in 2020. In addition, looking for a job while employed is not suitable for some people. When you&#x27;re already tired from work, and all that time after work is squeezed, what kind of state can you be in when you&#x27;re looking for a job? Of course, it doesn&#x27;t rule out that some people have this ability.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾于二零年亦曾欲离航天院，父阻之。终忍一年，二一年底拂袖而去。缘由非止于薪，乃工作内容、技术前瞻、人际关系等诸般因素所致。于斯期间，吾脱发、失眠，情绪抑郁。十一月离职，年后寻觅，三月入新职，薪资略有增益，然心境大悦，食欲亦佳。市况颓靡，宜早离为上。纵难觅佳职，亦非绝无可能。若待数年后遭优化，岂非更难？楼主之友，优化之险甚巨。听与不听，终须自负。时吾亦欲观变，然偶思之，若早识时务，力排众议，二零年辞职岂不更妙？且彼时就业环境亦胜如今。骑驴觅马之策，于某些人并不适用。既已疲惫不堪，何余裕再寻新职？</details></li><li>@belin520 #4 Haha, but judging from the poster&#x27;s posting history, this girlfriend is the poster herself.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@belin520 #4 观其发帖履历，此女友或为楼主本人。</details></li><li>@jinksw Not very rich, just a normal family<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@jinksw 家境寻常，非巨富之家。</details></li><li>Respect other people&#x27;s fate, is it your turn to give them pointers on their life?
