            <p>My friend is a 98-year-old female, a graduate of a 211 university.
She currently works in the technology department of a bank. The workload is moderate, and she needs to work overtime, but the pressure is not high. Overtime is caused by the atmosphere. My friend has some technical pursuits, but everyone knows the technology of banks. Although there are new technologies, there are many old things. The current total package is about 300,000, but since she has always been a marginal person at work, a little transparent, and the work assigned is not very important, her performance has been rated poorly. This year, her salary has been reduced by 10,000. If she is still rated poorly this year, she will be optimized, so she is very depressed. In addition, my friend also mentioned that she is not used to the workplace atmosphere in the bank, such as learning to actively express herself and claim credit, so she is considering finding another job.
My friend interviewed for an outsourcing position at a major Internet company, which can increase her current income by 30% and also do more technically related content, rather than doing more management-oriented work like in the bank, so she is very excited and plans to quit her job and prepare for a period of time to wait and see for a better place to go.
I dissuaded her, thinking that it would be more appropriate to find a new job while still employed. However, my friend wants to pursue her ideals, so I didn&#x27;t persuade her any more. Yuanfang, what do you think?</p>

                <p>朋友 98 年女生，某 211 大学毕业
目前在某银行科技部工作，工作强度中规中矩，需要加班，但是压力不大，加班是氛围导致，朋友是有点技术追求的，但是银行的技术大家懂的都懂，虽然新的技术有，但旧的东西偏多。目前总包在 30W 左右，但由于工作以来一直是边缘人角色，小透明，被分配的工作也不是非常重要，导致绩效一直被评差，今年还被降薪了 1W ，今年如果还被评差的话，就会被优化，于是心情倍受打击，此外朋友还提到不适应银行内的职场氛围，比如要学会主动表现自己，邀功之类的，遂考虑另寻高就。
朋友面试过某互联网大厂外包，能在目前的流水上涨薪 30%，也能做更偏向技术相关的内容，而不是和银行一样做管理偏多的工作，所以很心动，打算裸辞，再备战备战一段时间，观望一下更好的去处。
我劝阻了一下，觉得骑驴找马更合适。奈何朋友要追求自己的理想，所以没再多劝了。元芳，你怎么看</p>

A few months of savings should be enough, especially for those who haven&#x27;t changed jobs in a few years. Their understanding of the entire market environment may still be from a few years ago, and they think they can change jobs easily and get a raise when they jump. The biggest problem with quitting without another job is: rashly cutting off your retreat! These people start by playing in the first month, then in the second month they submit resumes and find that there are very few responses, and in the third month they start to anxiously submit resumes in bulk, and then they have to accept a job that is not formal, has a pay cut, requires overtime, and has a long commute. If you don&#x27;t have money, you have to do such a job, and if you have money, you can barely survive a six-month gap.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>裸辞最大的问题不是钱，几个月的存粮不至于没有，尤其是对于几年没换工作的人，他们对于整个市场环境的认知可能还是几年前的，觉得还能随便换工作，跳槽必涨薪，此处不留爷，必有留爷处。裸辞最大的问题就是：贸然把自己后路给断了！这种人刚开始都是第一个月玩，第二个月投简历发现投简历回复寥寥无几，第三个月开始焦虑海投，然后不得已接受了一份，非正编，降薪，加班，通勤远的工作。如果你没钱你不得不去做这样的工作，如果你有钱，空窗半年也够呛。</details></li><li>@SupperHobby #22 She has a boyfriend, what&#x27;s it to you?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@SupperHobby #22 有对象了，关你什么事呢？</details></li><li>In 2020, I wanted to quit my job at a certain aerospace research institute, but I didn&#x27;t quit after listening to my dad&#x27;s advice. In the end, I endured it for a year and quit at the end of 2021. The main reason was not related to income, but was a combination of work content, technological development, interpersonal relationships, and other factors. In short, during my stay in this unit, I had constant hair loss, insomnia, and emotional depression. I left in November, and played until after the Chinese New Year. During this period, I paid for social security with my own money. After the New Year, I started looking for a job around February, and joined a new company in March. The total package increased by about a quarter. The biggest difference was that I felt much better and had a better appetite. One point that no one mentioned above is that because the market is declining, it is better to leave sooner if you want to leave. Even if it is difficult to find a job now, it is not impossible to find one. If you are optimized out in a few years, wouldn&#x27;t it be even more difficult to find one? The poster&#x27;s friend is at risk of being optimized anyway, and it seems to be quite high. Of course, regardless of whether I listened to the advice or not, I know that I am ultimately responsible. At that time, I decided to endure it for a year to see if there would be any turning point in the institute. But occasionally I also feel that if I could have seen the situation more clearly at the time, and had more courage to argue with my family, I would have quit in 20 years, wouldn&#x27;t I have avoided suffering for that year and wasting a year of time, and the employment environment in 20 years would have been better. In addition, finding a job while still employed is not suitable for everyone. It is already very tiring to go to work, and if all the time after work is squeezed in, what kind of state will you be in when you go to find a job? Of course, it is not ruled out that some people have this ability.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我 2020 年在某航天研究所想裸辞，听了我爸的劝没辞。最后忍了一年 2021 年底还是辞了，主要原因和收入无关，是综合了工作内容、技术发展、人际关系等多方面原因，总之呆在这单位期间，持续性脱发、失眠、情绪抑郁。11 月走的，玩到过年后，这期间花钱交的社保，年后大概 2 月开始找工作，3 月份入职了新的公司，总包涨了四分之一左右，最不同的是人的心情好了不少，吃饭胃口都好了。有一点上面都没人提，正因为市场是下行的，如果要走的话还不如早点走。就算现在找工作难，也不是完全找不着，如果再过几年被优化出来，岂不是更难找？楼主朋友总归是有被优化风险的，而且看起来还不小。当然不管我听没听劝，我知道自己才是最终负责人，当时决定忍一年也是想看看在所里能不能有转机。但是偶尔也会觉得，如果自己当时更能看清现状 、更有魄力能够和家人据理力争，20 年就辞职出来，是不是不用白吃那一年苦、浪费一年时间，而且 20 年就业环境也更好点吧。另外骑驴找马对有的人并不合适，本来上班就很累，下班那点时间再全部挤占，你去找工作的时候能是个什么好状态呢？当然不排除一些人就是有这个能力。</details></li><li>@belin520 #4 Haha, but judging from the poster&#x27;s posting history, this girlfriend is the poster herself.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@belin520 #4 哈哈，不过从楼主的发帖履历来看，这个女朋友就是楼主她自己。</details></li><li>@jinksw Not very rich, just a normal family.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@jinksw 倒也没有很有钱，普通家庭吧</details></li><li>Respect other people&#x27;s fate.
