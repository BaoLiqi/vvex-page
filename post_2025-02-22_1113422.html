            <h3>关于哪吒 2 的建模风格混乱问题</h3>
        </details>
        <div class="content">
            <p>1. I haven&#x27;t seen it. 2. I went to see it with my wife because it was popular.

When the Dragon Queen appeared, I complained to my wife that the modeling style of this film was chaotic, a mix of Chinese and Western styles, like models built by seven or eight different teams.

The characters have Chinese styles, Disney styles, game styles, and realistic styles, plus the small animals are also in Western styles.

I saw someone on Weibo raise the same issue and was torn apart by Nezha fans.

Politely asking, in this case, is it possible that some of the models are &quot;open source&quot; models taken from other places?</p>

                <p>1 我没看，2 也是跟风和老婆去看了一下。

女龙王出场的时候我就跟老婆吐槽了一下，这个片的建模风格混乱，中西混搭，就像七八个不同团队的建的模。

人物有中式风格，有迪士尼风格，有游戏风格，还有类真人的风格，再加上小动物也是西式风格。

我看微博有人提出同样的问题，被哪吒粉丝冲烂了。

礼貌问下，像这种情况，是不是有的建模也是从别处拿来的“开源”模型？</p>

                <li>@HL8 Another one who can&#x27;t make it cold can&#x27;t evaluate the air conditioner, right? Anyone with eyes can see that the modeling style is inconsistent.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@HL8 又一个不会制冷不能评价空调是吧？建模画风不统一这个长眼睛的都能看出来吧</details></li><li>@gransh I didn&#x27;t mention the box office. I haven&#x27;t seen this movie yet. I just wanted to see if you understand art or have any insights. I didn&#x27;t expect you to be incompetent and quite aggressive, haha. It&#x27;s cute to see you rage helplessly.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@gransh 我可没提过票房二字，我至今没看过这个电影。我只是想看看你是懂美术还是有高见，没想到没本事，戾气还挺大，哈哈。看你无能狂怒的样子挺可爱的。</details></li><li>@HL8 Brain-dead fan, identified. You must be one of those who helps capitalists boost the box office and thinks they are doing something glorious for the country.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@HL8 脑残粉一枚，鉴定完毕。帮资本家冲票房觉得自己为国争光的里面一份子肯定有你吧</details></li><li>@gransh #4 This 3# HL8 has a problem with his brain. Just look at his past comments and block him. Why waste so much time arguing?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@gransh #4       这个 3# HL8       脑子有问题，看看他的历史评论，直接拉黑就行了，浪费这么多时间对线干啥。</details></li><li>Groundhog, Immortal Palace, Ao Guang, Three Dragon Kings, and Nezha do have different anime styles. Although it&#x27;s a bit strange, it didn&#x27;t affect my viewing at the time.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>土拨鼠 、仙宫、熬光 、三大龙王、哪吒 动漫风格确实不一样，虽然有点奇怪，但是当时并不影响我看</details></li><li>@HL8 I am from a 3D animation film team in China. I can tell you from a professional point of view that the modeling and special effects design are indeed very chaotic, but I personally feel that its popularity has little to do with the production level. On the one hand, fewer people are traveling this year, so it&#x27;s suitable to save money and watch a movie that is suitable for the whole family and has both laughs and tears. On the other hand, it can help netizens avoid topics that shouldn&#x27;t be discussed during the Chinese New Year and control the direction of the chat. (Purely personal opinion)<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@HL8 我就是国内做三维动画影片团队的，可以告诉你专业角度来说，确实不管是模型还是特效设计都很乱，但其实个人感觉它的火爆和制作水准关系有但不大。一方面大家过年今年旅游变少了，省钱看个适合全家一起的笑点泪点兼具的电影适合，另一方面可以让网友们过年避开不该聊的话题，控制聊天方向。（纯个人看法）</details></li><li>First of all, mixed style is an animation style called super mix. It doesn&#x27;t mean that only a unified style is good. Pixar (various Toy Story films), Universal (The Super Mario Bros. Movie), KADOKAWA PICTURES (a mobile game adaptation), and Toei Animation (various tokusatsu series) have all released similar examples. Generally, family-friendly animations like to shoot in this style. Note that family-friendly doesn&#x27;t equal teen-oriented; rather, it needs to cater to the tastes of users of multiple age groups. If you don&#x27;t watch many animated films, you can refer to the designs of some games, such as Nintendo&#x27;s Super Mario Odyssey, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Blizzard&#x27;s Overwatch, and SE&#x27;s Final Fantasy. You will find that there are many styles that are fragmented from the original design.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>首先混搭是一种叫做 super mix 的动画风格并不是说只有统一画风才是好的皮克斯（各种总动员 ） 环球（马里奥大电影） KADOKAWA PICTURES （某手游改编） 东映（各种皮套系）都出过类似的先例一般合家欢式的动画就喜欢拍这种注意是合家欢式的 合家欢不等同于面向青少年 而是需要兼顾多个年龄层品味的用户如果你看的动画电影少 可以参考一些游戏的设计比如任天堂的超级马里奥奥德赛 异度神剑 2 暴雪的守望先锋 SE 的最终幻想你都会发现有很多从原案设计上就分崩离析的画风</details></li><li>When 138 animation companies are doing things, as a science and engineering person, shouldn&#x27;t you learn about the film&#x27;s very strong control and management, instead of talking nonsense about aesthetics that you are not good at... Most people think about it, managing 138 people to control a project... the result may generally be garbage. In addition, I want to say that mixed style is not a big problem, or not a problem at all, as long as the audience accepts it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>一共 138 家动画公司做的事情的时候，作为一个理工科的人，难道你不应该学习学习这个电影在控制和管理上非常强的一方面，而不是把自己不擅长的审美方面瞎逼逼……大多数人自己想一想，自己管理 138 号人控一个项目……做出来可能一般都是垃圾。另外我想说的是，混搭风格并不是什么大问题或者说根本就不是问题，只要观众接受就行了。</details></li><li>@HL8 If you haven&#x27;t seen it, then you don&#x27;t even have the right to reply, get out of here.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@HL8 你要是没看过，那你连回复的资格都没有，赶紧滚吧</details></li><li>Of course, as long as there is creation, there will inevitably be plagiarism issues.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>肯定啊，只要创作必然会有抄袭问题</details></li><li>The work was subcontracted to many companies, some of which were produced separately by multiple companies in Shandong. There were also rework after completion, and there were also unqualified work that was transferred to other companies for re-doing.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>分包给了很多公司，其中一部分还是山东多个公司分别制作的。还有做完了返工的，也有做完了不合格被转交给其他公司重新做的。</details></li><li>@gransh Shouldn&#x27;t you watch and say less if you don&#x27;t understand enough? Why do you admit that you are not professional enough, and you are still so aggressive? You can identify the style with your eyes, but I can&#x27;t, I&#x27;m not as good as you. I don&#x27;t have enough professional knowledge.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@gransh 不够懂难道不是应该多看少说吗？怎么你自己都承认你不够专业了，戾气还这么大。你鉴定风格定义长眼睛就能看出来，我不行，没你厉害。我专业知识不够。</details></li><li>@HL8 You have to complain and squeeze out things that others see that you don&#x27;t? This habit is not good.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@HL8 你看不见的东西别人看见了，你就要吐槽和挤兑？这个习惯不好</details></li><li>Politely replying, the film company probably didn&#x27;t say that they made the animation by themselves, and didn&#x27;t say that they did all the modeling themselves. You can see many articles mentioning that they hired many teams to produce it, and they also listed the names of many production teams. In my personal opinion, the modeling style of Nezha 2 didn&#x27;t affect my viewing, and didn&#x27;t make me feel that it wasn&#x27;t worth the price of the ticket. Other well-known animated films didn&#x27;t give me a significantly better feeling in this regard. Everyone has their own opinion on an animated film, maybe you are not satisfied, but there are also many people who are not dissatisfied, everyone respects each other.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>礼貌回复一下，片方应该没有说过是自己一家做的动画，没说全部自己做建模，可以看到很多文章提到是找了很多团队制作，也列举了很多制作团队的名字。个人感官上，哪吒 2 的建模风格没有影响我的观看，没有让我觉得不值票价，其他知名动画电影也没有在这方面给我一种明显更棒的感官。每个人对一部动画电影都有自己的看法，或许你不满意，但是也有很多人没有觉得不满意，大家相互尊重</details></li><li>You guessed it, a total of 138 animation companies made it, including six core teams: Fantawild Animation of Boonie Bears, Light Chaser Animation of White Snake, Coloroom Pictures and October Media of Deep Sea, Original Force of A Mortal&#x27;s Journey, and base effects of The Wandering Earth.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你猜对了，一共 138 家动画公司做的，包括六个核心团队：熊出没的方特、白蛇的追光、深海的彩条屋和十月、凡人修仙传的原力，以及流浪地球的 base 特效。</details></li><li>@gransh You admitted that you are not professional, why give others an unprofessional definition? Is it interesting?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@gransh 自己都承认不专业了，何必给别人下不专业的定义？有意思吗？</details></li><li>Liberals are having a hard time lately~~<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>最近自由派过的也很艰难啊~~</details></li><li>After V2EX opened up invitations, there are more and more people stepping on sewing machines.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>V 站放开邀请后，踩缝纫机的是越来越多了。</details></li><li>The modeling is indeed a bit chaotic. I can only say that this film really pleased many Chinese audiences from all angles, including the content and various metaphors. It&#x27;s a very commercial film. Of course, success is one aspect. In terms of artistic value, it is still far behind.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>建模确实有点乱，只能说这片子从各个角度确实讨好了很多中观众群，包括内容和各种隐喻，非常商业的商业片。 当然成功是一方面，论艺术价值还差很远</details></li><li>I should have seen the clips, the only thing I&#x27;m unhappy about is the Dragon King. I feel like he doesn&#x27;t have the temperament of a king, at most he&#x27;s just a big brother.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>都应上看过切片，唯一不爽的是龙王，感觉没有当王的气质，最多就是大哥哥</details></li>
