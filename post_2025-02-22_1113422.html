        <h2>关于哪吒 2 的建模风格混乱问题</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>1 I didn't watch it, 2 was just following the trend and went to see it with my wife.

When the female Dragon King appeared, I complained to my wife that the modeling style of this film was chaotic, a mix of Chinese and Western styles, like models built by seven or eight different teams.

The characters have Chinese style, Disney style, game style, and realistic style, plus the animals are also in Western style.

I saw someone on Weibo raise the same question and was bombarded by Nezha fans.

Politely asking, in this kind of situation, are some of the models "open source" models taken from other places?</p>
            <p>1 我没看，2 也是跟风和老婆去看了一下。

女龙王出场的时候我就跟老婆吐槽了一下，这个片的建模风格混乱，中西混搭，就像七八个不同团队的建的模。

人物有中式风格，有迪士尼风格，有游戏风格，还有类真人的风格，再加上小动物也是西式风格。

我看微博有人提出同样的问题，被哪吒粉丝冲烂了。

礼貌问下，像这种情况，是不是有的建模也是从别处拿来的“开源”模型？</p>

                <li>@HL8 Another one who can't evaluate air conditioners because they don't know how to make them cold, right? Anyone with eyes can see that the modeling style is inconsistent.<br>@HL8 又一个不会制冷不能评价空调是吧？建模画风不统一这个长眼睛的都能看出来吧</li><li>@gransh I didn't mention the box office figures. I haven't seen this movie yet. I just wanted to see if you understand art or have any brilliant insights. I didn't expect you to be incompetent and so aggressive, haha. It's cute to see you raging helplessly.<br>@gransh 我可没提过票房二字，我至今没看过这个电影。我只是想看看你是懂美术还是有高见，没想到没本事，戾气还挺大，哈哈。看你无能狂怒的样子挺可爱的。</li><li>@HL8 A brainless fan, confirmed. You must be one of those helping capitalists boost box office and thinking you are fighting for the country.<br>@HL8 脑残粉一枚，鉴定完毕。帮资本家冲票房觉得自己为国争光的里面一份子肯定有你吧</li><li>@gransh #4 This 3# HL8 has a problem with his brain. Just look at his historical comments and block him. What's the point of wasting so much time arguing?<br>@gransh #4       这个 3# HL8       脑子有问题，看看他的历史评论，直接拉黑就行了，浪费这么多时间对线干啥。</li><li>The art styles of Groundhog, Immortal Palace, Ao Guang, the Three Dragon Kings, and Nezha are indeed different. Although it's a bit strange, it didn't affect my viewing experience at the time.<br>土拨鼠 、仙宫、熬光 、三大龙王、哪吒 动漫风格确实不一样，虽然有点奇怪，但是当时并不影响我看</li><li>@HL8 I'm from a domestic 3D animation film team. From a professional point of view, I can tell you that the model and special effects design is indeed very chaotic, but I personally feel that its popularity doesn't have much to do with the production level. On the one hand, fewer people traveled during the Spring Festival this year, so it's suitable to save money and watch a movie with laughter and tears that is suitable for the whole family. On the other hand, it allows netizens to avoid topics that shouldn't be discussed during the Spring Festival and control the direction of the conversation. (Purely personal opinion)<br>@HL8 我就是国内做三维动画影片团队的，可以告诉你专业角度来说，确实不管是模型还是特效设计都很乱，但其实个人感觉它的火爆和制作水准关系有但不大。一方面大家过年今年旅游变少了，省钱看个适合全家一起的笑点泪点兼具的电影适合，另一方面可以让网友们过年避开不该聊的话题，控制聊天方向。（纯个人看法）</li><li>First of all, mixed style is a kind of animation style called super mix, which does not mean that only unified style is good. Pixar (various Totals), Universal (Mario Movie), KADOKAWA PICTURES (a mobile game adaptation), Toei (various tokusatsu series) have all had similar precedents. Generally, family-friendly animations like to shoot this kind of thing. Note that family-friendly is not the same as for teenagers, but needs to take into account the tastes of users of multiple age groups. If you watch few animated movies, you can refer to some game designs, such as Nintendo's Super Mario Odyssey, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Blizzard's Overwatch, and SE's Final Fantasy. You will find that there are many fragmented styles from the original design.<br>首先混搭是一种叫做 super mix 的动画风格并不是说只有统一画风才是好的皮克斯（各种总动员 ） 环球（马里奥大电影） KADOKAWA PICTURES （某手游改编） 东映（各种皮套系）都出过类似的先例一般合家欢式的动画就喜欢拍这种注意是合家欢式的 合家欢不等同于面向青少年 而是需要兼顾多个年龄层品味的用户如果你看的动画电影少 可以参考一些游戏的设计比如任天堂的超级马里奥奥德赛 异度神剑 2 暴雪的守望先锋 SE 的最终幻想你都会发现有很多从原案设计上就分崩离析的画风</li><li>When a total of 138 animation companies are doing things, as a person in science and engineering, shouldn't you learn about the very strong aspects of this film in control and management, instead of complaining about the aesthetic aspects that you are not good at... Most people think about it, managing a project with 138 people... the result would likely be trash. Also, I want to say that mixed styles are not a big problem, or not a problem at all, as long as the audience accepts it.<br>一共 138 家动画公司做的事情的时候，作为一个理工科的人，难道你不应该学习学习这个电影在控制和管理上非常强的一方面，而不是把自己不擅长的审美方面瞎逼逼……大多数人自己想一想，自己管理 138 号人控一个项目……做出来可能一般都是垃圾。另外我想说的是，混搭风格并不是什么大问题或者说根本就不是问题，只要观众接受就行了。</li><li>@HL8 If you haven't seen it, then you don't even have the right to reply, get out of here.<br>@HL8 你要是没看过，那你连回复的资格都没有，赶紧滚吧</li><li>Of course, as long as there is creation, there will inevitably be plagiarism issues.<br>肯定啊，只要创作必然会有抄袭问题</li><li>It was subcontracted to many companies, some of which were produced separately by multiple companies in Shandong. There were also those that were reworked after completion, and those that were unqualified and transferred to other companies for re-production.<br>分包给了很多公司，其中一部分还是山东多个公司分别制作的。还有做完了返工的，也有做完了不合格被转交给其他公司重新做的。</li><li>@gransh Shouldn't you watch more and talk less if you don't understand enough? How can you be so aggressive when you admit you're not professional enough? You can identify the style with your eyes, I can't, you're better than me. I don't have enough professional knowledge.<br>@gransh 不够懂难道不是应该多看少说吗？怎么你自己都承认你不够专业了，戾气还这么大。你鉴定风格定义长眼睛就能看出来，我不行，没你厉害。我专业知识不够。</li><li>@HL8 Others see what you can't see, and you start complaining and attacking? That's not a good habit.<br>@HL8 你看不见的东西别人看见了，你就要吐槽和挤兑？这个习惯不好</li><li>A polite reply, the film party should not have said that they made the animation by themselves, and did not say that they did all the modeling themselves. You can see many articles mentioning that they looked for many teams to produce it, and also listed the names of many production teams. Personally, the modeling style of Nezha 2 did not affect my viewing experience, and did not make me feel that it was not worth the ticket price. Other well-known animated films did not give me a significantly better impression in this regard either. Everyone has their own views on an animated film, maybe you are not satisfied, but there are also many people who are not dissatisfied. Everyone respect each other.<br>礼貌回复一下，片方应该没有说过是自己一家做的动画，没说全部自己做建模，可以看到很多文章提到是找了很多团队制作，也列举了很多制作团队的名字。个人感官上，哪吒 2 的建模风格没有影响我的观看，没有让我觉得不值票价，其他知名动画电影也没有在这方面给我一种明显更棒的感官。每个人对一部动画电影都有自己的看法，或许你不满意，但是也有很多人没有觉得不满意，大家相互尊重</li><li>You guessed it, a total of 138 animation companies made it, including six core teams: Fantawild from Boonie Bears, Light Chaser from White Snake, Colorful Clouds and October from Deep Sea, Yuanli from A Record of a Mortal’s Journey to Immortality, and base effects from The Wandering Earth.<br>你猜对了，一共 138 家动画公司做的，包括六个核心团队：熊出没的方特、白蛇的追光、深海的彩条屋和十月、凡人修仙传的原力，以及流浪地球的 base 特效。</li><li>@gransh You admitted you are not professional, why give others the definition of unprofessional? Is it interesting?<br>@gransh 自己都承认不专业了，何必给别人下不专业的定义？有意思吗？</li><li>Liberals are having a hard time lately~~<br>最近自由派过的也很艰难啊~~</li><li>Since V Station opened up invitations, there are more and more people stepping on sewing machines (a euphemism for being censored or banned).<br>V 站放开邀请后，踩缝纫机的是越来越多了。</li><li>The modeling is indeed a bit chaotic. It can only be said that this film has pleased many Chinese audiences from various angles, including content and various metaphors, a very commercial film. Of course, success is one aspect, but it is far from artistic value.<br>建模确实有点乱，只能说这片子从各个角度确实讨好了很多中观众群，包括内容和各种隐喻，非常商业的商业片。 当然成功是一方面，论艺术价值还差很远</li><li>I've seen clips of it, and the only thing I don't like is the Dragon King, who doesn't feel like a king, at most just an older brother.<br>都应上看过切片，唯一不爽的是龙王，感觉没有当王的气质，最多就是大哥哥</li>
