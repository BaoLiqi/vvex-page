            <p>1. I haven&#x27;t watched it. 2. I only went to see it with my wife because it was trending.

When the Dragon Queen appeared, I complained to my wife that the modeling style of this movie was inconsistent, a mix of Chinese and Western styles, as if the models were built by seven or eight different teams.

The characters have Chinese style, Disney style, game style, and also lifelike style, plus the small animals are also Western style.

I saw someone on Weibo raise the same issue, and they were bombarded by Ne Zha fans.

Politely asking, in this case, are some of the models &#x27;open source&#x27; models taken from other places?</p>

                <p>一未观之，二者随潮流与妻往观。见龙母现身，遂与妻言，此片建模之风殊异，中西杂糅，若七八团队各施其能。

人物或具中华风韵，或仿迪士尼之形，或类游戏之设，又兼真人之貌，加之瑞兽皆染西洋之色。

吾见微薄有士亦提斯问，然遭哪吒拥趸围攻。

敢问诸君，此况之下，莫非有建模乃取自他处之“开源”模型乎？</p>

                <li>@HL8 Another one who can&#x27;t refrigerate and can&#x27;t evaluate air conditioning, right? Anyone with eyes can see that the modeling style is inconsistent.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@HL8 又一不善制冷，焉能评空调之辈？建模之风不一，明眼人皆可见也。</details></li><li>@gransh I never mentioned the box office. I still haven&#x27;t seen this movie. I just wanted to see if you understand art or have some high opinions. I didn&#x27;t expect you to be incompetent but have a lot of hostility, haha. It&#x27;s cute to see you raging impotently.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@gransh 吾未提票房一字，至今未观此影。唯欲观汝懂美术否，有高见否，未料无才而戾气甚重，可笑。观汝暴怒之态，甚为可人。</details></li><li>@HL8 A brain-dead fan, confirmed. You must be one of those who are boosting the box office for capitalists and think you are contributing to the country.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@HL8 脑残粉一枚，验明正身。助资本家冲高票房，自以为乃为国争光之士，必有汝焉。</details></li><li>@gransh #4 This 3# HL8 has a problem with his brain. Look at his historical comments, just block him directly, what&#x27;s the point of wasting so much time arguing?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@gransh #4 此三楼HL8脑有恙。观其往昔评论，径直屏蔽即可，何必耗费光阴对线？</details></li><li>Groundhog, Immortal Palace, Ao Guang, Three Dragon Kings, Ne Zha, the animation styles are indeed different. Although it&#x27;s a bit strange, it didn&#x27;t affect my viewing at the time.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>土拨鼠、仙宫、敖光、三龙王、哪吒，动漫之风格确有不同。虽稍显怪异，然于吾观影无碍。</details></li><li>@HL8 I am from a domestic 3D animation film team. I can tell you from a professional point of view that the model and special effects design are indeed very chaotic, but I personally feel that its popularity has something to do with the production level, but not much. On the one hand, everyone is traveling less during the Chinese New Year this year, saving money to watch a movie suitable for the whole family with laughter and tears. On the other hand, it can allow netizens to avoid topics that shouldn&#x27;t be discussed during the Chinese New Year and control the direction of the chat. (Purely personal opinion)<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@HL8 吾乃国内三维动画影片团队之人。可告汝以专业视角，模型与特效设计确有芜杂之象，然吾以为其火爆与制作水准关联虽有，然不大也。一方，今岁新春，旅游者众减，省金观一合家欢式，兼具欢笑与泪水之影，甚宜。另一方，可使网民避开新春不宜议论之题，掌控谈话方向。（纯属个人之见）</details></li><li>First of all, mixing and matching is an animation style called &#x27;super mix&#x27;. It doesn&#x27;t mean that only a unified style is good. Pixar (various Toy Story series), Universal (Mario movie), KADOKAWA PICTURES (a mobile game adaptation), Toei (various Tokusatsu series) have all done similar precedents. Generally, family-friendly animation likes to shoot this kind of thing. Note that family-friendly is not the same as targeting teenagers, but it needs to take into account the tastes of users of multiple age groups. If you watch few animated movies, you can refer to some game designs such as Nintendo&#x27;s Super Mario Odyssey, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Blizzard&#x27;s Overwatch, and SE&#x27;s Final Fantasy. You will find that there are many styles that are fragmented from the original design.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@HL8 兼杂并蓄，乃动画之风，名曰“超级混搭”。非谓唯统一画风方为佳。皮克斯（玩具总动员系列）、环球（马里奥电影）、KADOKAWA PICTURES （某手游改编）、东映（特摄系列）皆有先例。寻常合家欢式动画多喜用之。须知合家欢不等同于面向青少年，而需兼顾多年龄层用户之品味。若君观动画影片甚少，不妨参考游戏之设，如任天堂之《超级马里奥奥德赛》、《异度神剑2》，暴雪之《守望先锋》，SE之《最终幻想》，君可见其原案设计亦有分崩离析之风。</details></li><li>When a total of 138 animation companies are doing things, as a person in science and engineering, shouldn&#x27;t you learn about the very strong aspects of control and management of this movie, instead of blindly criticizing the aesthetic aspects that you are not good at... Most people should think about it, managing 138 people to control a project... the result is likely to be garbage. In addition, I want to say that the mixed style is not a big problem or not a problem at all, as long as the audience accepts it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>凡一百三十八家动画公司协力之事，君既为理工之人，岂不应习此影在管控方面之精诣，反倒于君所不擅之审美妄加置喙？世人但须自忖，统领一百三十八人控一项目，最终成果或皆为朽木。再者，吾欲言之，混搭之风非为大患，甚至根本无害，惟观众悦纳即可。</details></li><li>@HL8 If you haven&#x27;t watched it, then you don&#x27;t even have the right to reply, get out of here.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@HL8 君既未观之，则汝纵有辩辞亦枉然，速退散！</details></li><li>Of course, as long as there is creation, there will inevitably be plagiarism.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>创作之事，抄袭在所难免。</details></li><li>It was subcontracted to many companies, some of which were produced by multiple companies in Shandong. There were also those who reworked after completion, and there were also those who were unqualified and were transferred to other companies to redo.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>分包于众公司，其中不乏山东诸公司制成。既有完工返工者，亦有不合格转予他公司重制者。</details></li><li>@gransh Isn&#x27;t one should watch more and say less if they don&#x27;t understand enough? How can you still be so hostile when you admit that you are not professional enough? I can&#x27;t define the style that can be seen with the naked eye, I&#x27;m not as good as you. I don&#x27;t have enough professional knowledge.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@gransh 不够精通难道不是应该多看少说吗？怎么你自己都承认你不够专业了，戾气还这么大。你鉴定风格定义长眼睛就能看出来，我不行，没你厉害。我专业知识不够。</details></li><li>@HL8 You have to complain and squeeze if others see what you can&#x27;t see? This is not a good habit.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@HL8 见汝所不能见，即出言抱怨挤兑？此非良习也。</details></li><li>Politely reply, the film party should not have said that they made the animation themselves. They didn&#x27;t say that they made all the models themselves. You can see many articles mentioning that they found many teams to produce it, and they also listed the names of many production teams. Personally, the modeling style of Ne Zha 2 did not affect my viewing, and did not make me feel that it was not worth the price of the ticket. Other well-known animated films did not give me a significantly better feeling in this regard. Everyone has their own opinion on an animated film. Perhaps you are not satisfied, but there are also many people who are not dissatisfied, and everyone respects each other.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>礼貌回复，片方或未曾言动画皆由己作。亦未尝言所有建模皆由己为。可见诸文皆提及其寻诸团队制作，并列举诸多制作团队之名。吾以为，哪吒续集建模之风尚不损吾观影之兴致，不使吾觉不值票价。彼他声名远播之动画影片亦未尝予吾以显著更佳之感。众人对动画电影自有见解，君或不悦，然亦多有不以为然者，彼此尊重是也。</details></li><li>You guessed it, a total of 138 animation companies did it, including six core teams: Fantawild from Boonie Bears, Light Chaser Animation from White Snake, October and Coloredoom Pictures from Deep Sea, Force Pictures from A Mortal&#x27;s Journey, and Base FX from The Wandering Earth.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>所言甚是，凡百三十八家动画公司协力而成，内含六大核心团队：熊出没之方特、白蛇之追光、深海之彩条屋与乾坤造化、凡人修仙传之原力，以及流浪地球之Base FX。</details></li><li>@gransh You admit you are not professional, why give others a definition of unprofessional? Is it interesting?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@gransh 既已自承不专，何故妄下不专之定义？岂不谬哉？</details></li><li>The liberals have had a hard time recently~~<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>近来，自由派诸君似亦多艰。</details></li><li>Since V Station opened the invitation, there are more and more sewing machines being stepped on.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>V站放开邀请之后，踩缝纫机之人似渐增多。</details></li><li>The modeling is indeed a bit messy. Only one can say that this film does please many Chinese audiences from various perspectives, including content and various metaphors. It is a very commercial commercial film. Of course, success is one thing, but it is still far from artistic value.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>建模确有芜杂。唯可言此片从诸方面确已博得诸多华夏观众之欢心，囊括内容及诸多隐喻，实乃极具商业价值之商业片。固然，其成功可谓一事，论及艺术价值，则犹远矣。</details></li><li>I&#x27;ve seen the clips, the only thing I&#x27;m not happy about is the Dragon King, I don&#x27;t feel like he has the temperament of a king, at most he&#x27;s just a big brother<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>阅览切片，唯一不悦者乃龙王，殊无王者气度，至多不过一长兄尔।</details></li>
