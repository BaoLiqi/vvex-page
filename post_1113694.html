                <li>It's cheilitis. Just buy Vaseline (the most common kind) and apply a thick layer before going to bed.<br>就是唇炎。直接买凡士林（最普通的那种），睡前厚涂就行</li><li>Try taking some vitamin B2? I take B2 all winter, mainly to prevent angular cheilitis. My lips are too easily chapped in the winter, and they heal very slowly. Taking B2 consistently avoids the problem.<br>吃点维生素 B2 试试？我到冬天就一直吃 B2 ，主要是预防口角疮，我到冬天嘴唇太容易崩口了，而且还好的特别慢，一直吃 B2 就基本不会有问题。</li><li>Maling Gouzi lip balm has no disadvantages except that it is expensive, it is very useful.<br>马林狗子唇膏，除了贵没缺点，巨好用</li><li>Drink more water, drink more water, drink more water!<br>多喝水 多喝水 多喝水！</li><li>Cheilitis?<br>唇炎？</li><li>Baifubang, there is a repairing lip balm, the effect is quite good.<br>百肤邦， 有个修复润唇膏，效果还蛮不错</li><li>Drink more plain water. It won't work in a day or two. Drink it for a long time to see the effect. Drink less tea.<br>多喝白水, 一天两天没用, 长期喝,才能看到效果,  少喝茶</li><li>One is dryness, and it may also be a lack of vitamins, which is related to your eating habits.<br>一个是干燥，也可能是缺乏维生素啥的跟你饮食习惯有关</li><li>@JunNKG What is the principle? I make tea during work and drink it until I get off work. I don't feel sleepy😂<br>@JunNKG 什么原理啊, 现在是上班泡茶, 喝到下班, 不喝困啊😂</li><li>When I was a student, I would buy a lip balm for about 30 yuan. Since I bought a Sky Electric Kettle, I finally discovered a new continent and found out that drinking hot water can solve the problem. I also use Shurui frostbite cream on my hands.<br>当年学生时代，动不动跟风买一根差不多 30 块的唇膏，自从有次买了个天际电热水壶，终于发现了片新大陆，原来喝热水就能解决。手抺的有蜀睿冻疮膏</li><li>@ArthurTsang I used to do that too. I asked ChatGPT, and it seems to be divided into 2 points: 1. Tea polyphenols and caffeine will take away moisture from the mouth. 2. The high temperature of the tea can also cause dry mouth.<br>@ArthurTsang 我之前也干, chatGPT 问了一下, 好像分 2 点, 1.茶多酚和咖啡因会带走口腔水分. 2.茶水温度高, 也会导致口腔干燥.</li><li>After reading the comments, I will persist in drinking water and see the effect.<br>看了评论 先坚持喝水 看看效果</li><li>Drink water and eat vitamin B<br>喝水， 吃维 B</li><li>You can try the little blue can, the repair effect is quite good.<br>可以试试小蓝罐，修复效果还不错</li><li>Drink more water and eat more fruit.<br>多喝水 多吃水果</li><li>Eat carrots, steamed or fried, it has been tested and is effective. Vitamin B doesn't work for me.<br>吃胡萝卜，蒸好的或者是炒过的，亲测有效。维生素 b 对我来说不管用</li><li>Exfoliative cheilitis, it is recommended to see a doctor.<br>脱落性唇炎，建议还是找医生看看</li><li>Tacrolimus ointment<br>他克莫司软膏</li><li>Mine too, my lips are constantly peeling regardless of spring, summer, autumn and winter😭😭<br>我的也是，嘴唇就不断的起皮不分春夏秋冬😭😭</li><li>Just search for Vaseline on JD.com, I peeled too, and this one worked well.<br>京东搜索凡士林就行，我也脱，用的这个就好了。</li>
