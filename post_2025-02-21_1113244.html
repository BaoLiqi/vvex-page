            <p>It&#x27;s an old, small, and dilapidated top-floor apartment, 6 floors in total, with a layout that I like the most, arguably the best layout within my limited budget.

But the only drawback is that it&#x27;s on the top floor. I would have bought it immediately if it was one floor lower. This is the only unit for sale in this complex, and there are no plans to install an elevator.

I haven&#x27;t lived on the top floor before, and I&#x27;m wondering if the rumors about leaks, being hot in the summer and cold in the winter, the despair of climbing stairs every time, and the issue of resale value are true.

                <p>Seeking the Dao on a dilapidated peak, six layers high. The layout resonates with the spirit, the best among limited resources. Alas, it stands at the summit, a hurdle to immortality. One step lower, and the decision would be immediate. This dwelling alone awaits its master; no lifting cloud ladders (elevators) are foreseen.

Never having ascended to such heights, tales of water tribulation, fiery summers, icy winters, the burden of the endless stairway, and the diminished value in future transactions echo in my mind.

                <li>Just four words: Don&#x27;t buy it. Take it or leave it, it&#x27;s not my money anyway.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>四字真言：莫购此楼。听与不听，非吾之财</details></li><li>Leaks on the top floor are a matter of time.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>顶楼渗漏，乃时日之患</details></li><li>Leaks are inevitable, especially for old and dilapidated buildings, which have already been in use for a long time. Also, if there are elderly people, climbing the stairs is a lot of pressure. It&#x27;s also a lot of pressure for children to climb the stairs. It&#x27;s really tiring to carry things up and down when the kids go out to play, like a stroller or something. The advantage is that the sunlight is good and there are no obstructions; also, there is no noise overhead.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>渗漏乃必然之劫，尤以老旧之所为甚。年久失修，犹如丹田受损。若有老者，攀登之苦，更甚心魔。幼童亦苦，携物上下，如负灵石。然其利，阳光普照，无遮无挡；头顶清净，免受喧嚣。</details></li><li>The advantage is that you can enjoy sunbathing in the winter.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>冬日可享日光浴，聊以慰藉</details></li><li>I definitely don&#x27;t recommend buying it. Don&#x27;t be impulsive, especially for old and dilapidated buildings.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>绝不荐购！切勿冲动，老破小尤甚</details></li><li>You can buy it in the core area of the city, but not in the non-core area.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>若处灵脉之地则可购，非核心区则罢</details></li><li>Find a similar unit in the complex and rent it for a month to understand. It&#x27;s better to experience it yourself than to get advice from others.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>寻其小区同类，赁居一月，自可明了。胜于他人空言半日</details></li><li>I live on the first floor, and I have to say that the top floor is garbage. Leaks are the kind that make you anxious but you can&#x27;t do anything about it, a strong sense of powerlessness. In addition, climbing the stairs will greatly reduce your desire to go out. If your parents are old, they won&#x27;t be able to come because they can&#x27;t climb up. The only good thing is that the sunlight is really good.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾居底层，亦言顶楼乃废土。渗漏之苦，徒增烦恼，无力回天。且登楼之难，使人足不出户。若父母年迈，更难造访。唯阳光尚可称道。</details></li><li>This floor plan is not good. The secondary bedroom has poor ventilation and lighting, and the living room is actually very small, not enough space to move around. The balcony is not enclosed. And it&#x27;s on the top floor. I strongly advise you not to consider it. Even if the floor plan is fine, just the fact that it&#x27;s on the top floor is something you should be cautious about, unless the price is very low.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此户型甚劣，次卧采光通风皆废，客厅亦狭小，难以施展。阳台未封，尤为不妥。且居顶楼，更应三思。纵户型尚可，仅顶楼一患，便须万分审慎，除非价格极低</details></li><li>I&#x27;ve been waiting for a house in this complex, but no one has listed one. Indeed, the disadvantages are significant.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>久候此小筑，竟无人挂牌，果然缺陷昭然</details></li><li>Climbing stairs is too tiring, especially when you&#x27;re carrying things.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>攀楼之苦，更甚负重</details></li><li>@loryyang #8 But on the one hand, I have experience renting on the top floor, so it is really nice to sunbathe or feel the breeze on the balcony. But when buying a house, let&#x27;s wait.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@loryyang #8 尝租顶楼，阳台之上，沐日迎风，实乃快事。然购房之事，还需静候机缘</details></li><li>Don&#x27;t buy it. Climbing stairs is really troublesome. I live on the 3rd floor, actually climbing 2 floors. I&#x27;m too lazy to go to the 7th-floor balcony. Before moving, I even planned to plant flowers and plants on the roof.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>莫购！攀楼甚烦。吾居三层，实攀二层，顶楼七楼阳台，亦懒于前往。迁居之前，曾欲于顶楼植草种花</details></li><li>It&#x27;s exactly the problems you mentioned. There were leaks in my house and the property management found someone to fix it several times, but it still leaked. In the end, I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore and spent a few thousand dollars to fix it myself, but I can&#x27;t guarantee when it will leak again. Summer is fine, it&#x27;s cool with air conditioning, but winter is really cold. It doesn&#x27;t work even if you turn on the air conditioning. You have to take out an electric oil heater or something to make it better. If the room is big, you have to pay a lot more for electricity.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>确如君所言，房屋渗漏，物管修缮数次，仍未根绝。无奈之下，自掏灵石数千，略作修补，然难保日后无虞。夏日尚可，空凉甚爽，冬日则寒，空暖无力，需另取暖炉，方可御寒，房间若大，耗费灵石亦多。</details></li><li>I live on the top floor. I can tolerate climbing the stairs, but it&#x27;s more troublesome to buy things, especially large items, and it&#x27;s too restricted to move them up. I bought myself a small table and was exhausted carrying it up. I&#x27;ve experienced leaks, and the older the house, the more likely it is to leak. Mine was at the rainwater pipe, but it didn&#x27;t leak into the house. I don&#x27;t feel the winter cold and summer heat very much. Other than that, it&#x27;s quiet, which is also my main purpose for buying it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾居顶层，堪忍爬楼，然购物多艰，大件搬运尤难。吾自购小桌，抬升亦乏。曾遇渗漏，屋老则易漏，吾家雨水管口，幸未入室。冬寒夏热，感之不甚。此外，唯有清静，此乃购房之初衷。</details></li><li>It&#x27;s urgent to buy a house, and I don&#x27;t want to rent here for a moment. I have to renew the lease soon, and I almost wavered. The powerful V station is still reliable.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>购房之事，迫在眉睫，不愿再租片刻。续租在即，险些动摇。幸有V站道友，助吾坚定道心。</details></li><li>Don&#x27;t buy it, don&#x27;t buy it even if the price is low. As long as the house isn&#x27;t too broken, fixing a leak isn&#x27;t a big problem, but there are many other disadvantages. It&#x27;s especially hot in the summer and especially cold in the winter; the extra electricity bill you pay for air conditioning can be used to get a lower floor. When the water consumption is high in the summer, the water pressure is not enough and the water is very low; it&#x27;s really tiring to take things upstairs, especially large appliances; if you order a bottled water, the delivery person won&#x27;t come up, or they&#x27;ll charge extra; if you have to say an advantage, it&#x27;s quiet Basically no one bothers you, and even thieves are too lazy to come up. If the roof is inaccessible, it is even quieter, you can&#x27;t hear other people&#x27;s footsteps or the sound of chair legs rubbing on the ground, or the sound of marbles falling on the ground. If the roof can go up, it is convenient to dry clothes The quilt is easy, and you can also plant flowers and vegetables on it without worrying about the sewers being blocked, and the blockage will not affect you.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>切莫购之，价再低亦莫购。若房屋非破败至极，修补漏水不难，然弊端甚多。夏日酷暑，冬天严寒；空灵之费，可换低层。夏日用水高峰，水压不足，水流甚微；购大件家电，搬运登楼，苦不堪言；订桶装水，送货之人，不愿上楼，或索额外灵石；若寻优点，唯清静尔，鲜有人扰，盗贼亦懒于登门。若楼顶难达，则更静，听不见他者脚步，椅腿摩擦声，或珠落之音。若楼顶可至，晾晒衣物甚便，亦可植花种菜，不惧下水道堵塞，阻塞亦殃及不到自身。</details></li><li>It is not recommended to buy the top floor: 1. There is a high probability of water leaks and seepage. If the property maintenance fund is not available, you have to pay for it yourself. If it is available, it is also very troublesome to get signatures from every household. If some die-hards refuse to sign, you can only pay for it yourself. 2. It&#x27;s too hot in the summer. Some people lay insulation on the roof, which also requires the permission of the property management. If it is not allowed, there is no solution. If there are die-hards in the same building who object, there is basically no way to solve it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>不荐购顶楼：一，极易渗漏，若无物业修缮金，则需自掏腰包，若有此金，挨家挨户签名亦烦，如有人执迷不悟，拒不签名，只得自认倒霉。二，夏日酷热，有人于楼顶铺设隔热层，亦需物业许可，若不允，则无解也，万一有同楼顽固反对，几无解决之法。</details></li><li>It is strongly not recommended to have an old and dilapidated building on the top floor without an elevator. Top floor leaks are difficult to deal with, it&#x27;s not like you can fix it if you have money. You don&#x27;t know when the next leak will come.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>无电梯，楼顶老破小，切勿考虑。顶楼漏水极难处理，非有灵石便可解，不知下次漏水何时至矣。</details></li><li>I have never bought a house, but I have rented a house in Beijing. Unfortunately, I have encountered roof leaks several times, but I have not encountered summer warmth because Beijing rarely has light rain. Summer warmth is certain, and you can clearly feel the heat from the sun. You have to turn on the air conditioner early in the morning. Winter coolness is okay, Beijing&#x27;s heating is okay. The despair of climbing stairs is okay for young people, but it&#x27;s really not okay for old people and children. Resale liquidity, this is for sure, you see you have posted<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾未购屋，然在北京尝有租房之经历，不幸屡遇漏顶，倒未曾遇夏暖，盖因京城少降小雨，夏暖是肯定的，且能明显感受到烈日所晒之热，故而大清早就须开空调。冬凉倒是尚可，京城之暖气尚行，爬楼之绝望，于年轻人尚可，然于老幼，实为不适，转手之流通性，此事定然，君不见汝等发帖</details></li>
