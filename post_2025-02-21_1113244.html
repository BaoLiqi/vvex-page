            <p>It&#x27;s an old, small, and rundown top-floor apartment, with a total of 6 floors. The layout is the most appealing to me, and it can be said that it&#x27;s the best layout within this limited budget.

But the only downside is that it&#x27;s on the top floor. If it were just one floor lower, I would buy it immediately. This is the only unit for sale in this complex, and there are no plans to install an elevator.

I&#x27;ve never lived on the top floor. Are the issues of leaks, hot in summer and cold in winter, the despair of climbing stairs every time, and future resale liquidity really as bad as they say?

                <p>一套老破小顶楼平层，总高 6 层，户型是我最最中意的，可以说是在这有限的预算里面户型是最好的。

但唯一不足的是在顶楼，但凡低一层就立马买了。这小区就这一套在卖，也没有听说有加装电梯的计划。

没有住过顶楼，是否真的有所说的漏水、夏暖冬凉、每次爬楼都是绝望、及日后转手流通性的问题。

                <li>In four words, I don&#x27;t recommend buying it. Take it or leave it, it&#x27;s not my money anyway.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>就四个字，不建议买，爱听不听，反正花的不是我的钱</details></li><li>Roof leaks are only a matter of time.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>顶楼漏水是早晚的问题</details></li><li>Leaks are inevitable, especially in old and dilapidated buildings, which have already been in use for a long time. Also, if there are elderly people, climbing stairs is stressful. It&#x27;s also stressful for young children to climb stairs. It&#x27;s really tiring to carry things up and down, like strollers, when kids go out to play. The advantages are that the sunlight is good, there&#x27;s no obstruction, and there&#x27;s no noise from above.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>漏水是必然的，尤其是老破小，使用年限本身就已经比较长了。另外有老人，爬楼压力大。有小朋友爬楼压力也大，小朋友出去玩，带个车子啥的，真的很累，扛上扛下的。优点么，阳光好，无遮挡；另外头顶没噪音。</details></li><li>The advantage is that you can enjoy sunbathing in the winter.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>优点就是冬天可以享受阳光浴</details></li><li>Definitely not recommended to buy. Don&#x27;t be impulsive, especially for old and dilapidated apartments.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>绝对是不建议买的 不要冲动  特别是老破小</details></li><li>You can buy it in the local core area, but forget about it if it&#x27;s not in the core area.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>当地核心区可以买，非核心区就算了</details></li><li>Find a similar apartment in the complex and rent it for a month to see how it is. It&#x27;s better to suffer and live there than to be persuaded all day long.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你找个小区了同样的租一个月住住看就懂了。楼里劝半天不如你遭罪住住</details></li><li>I live on the first floor, and I have to say that the top floor is trash. Leaks are the kind of thing you worry about but can&#x27;t do anything about, the feeling of helplessness is huge. In addition, climbing stairs will greatly reduce your desire to go out. Parents can&#x27;t come if they&#x27;re older because they can&#x27;t climb the stairs. The only good thing is that the sunlight is really good.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我住一楼，我都要说，顶楼是垃圾漏水就是那种你看着着急，却一点办法都没，无力感巨强另外，爬楼梯会让你出门欲望大大下降。爸妈年纪大点就都来不了了，因为爬不上去唯一好处是，阳光是真好</details></li><li>This layout is not good. The ventilation and lighting in the secondary bedroom are a big problem. The living room is actually very small, excluding the dining area, and there&#x27;s not much room to move around. The balcony is not enclosed. And it&#x27;s on the top floor. I strongly suggest you don&#x27;t consider it. Even if the layout is okay, you should be cautious just because of the top floor, unless the price is very low.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>这个户型并不好，次卧通风采光问题很大，客厅除去餐厅其实很小，活动不开。阳台还没封。又是顶楼，强烈建议不要考虑。即使是户型没问题，单单一个顶楼这个因素，你都要慎重，除非价格很低。</details></li><li>I&#x27;ve been waiting for a house in this complex to be listed, but no one has listed one. Indeed, the disadvantages are significant.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>一直在蹲这个小区的房子，没有人挂出来。确实，缺点是显著的。</details></li><li>Climbing stairs is too tiring, and it&#x27;s even more tiring to carry things.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>爬楼太累了，再拎点东西更累</details></li><li>@loryyang #8 However, to be fair, I rented a top-floor apartment before, so I have experience. It&#x27;s really nice to sunbathe or get some fresh air on the balcony. But if you&#x27;re buying a house, you should wait a little longer.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@loryyang #8 不过有一说一，我租房租过顶楼，所以还是有经验，在阳台晒太阳或者吹风那是真的爽。但买房子么，还是再等等吧</details></li><li>Don&#x27;t buy it. Climbing stairs is really troublesome. I live on the 3rd floor, actually climbing 2 floors. I&#x27;m too lazy to go to the 7th-floor rooftop balcony... Before moving, I even planned to plant flowers and plants on the roof.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>不买 爬楼真的麻烦 我住 3 层 实际爬楼 2 层 楼顶 7 楼阳台我都懒得去。。之前搬家前还打算在楼顶种花花草草来着</details></li><li>It&#x27;s exactly the problems you mentioned. The house I live in also has property management, and I asked them to repair it several times, but it still leaked. I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore, so I spent several thousand yuan to fix it myself, but there&#x27;s no guarantee when it will leak again. Summer is fine, it&#x27;s cool with the air conditioner, but winter is really cold. The air conditioner doesn&#x27;t work, especially when the outdoor temperature is low. You have to take out an oil heater or something to make it a little better. And if the room is big, you definitely need to pay a lot more for electricity.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>就是你说的这几个问题，家里房子还有物业呢找修了好几次还是漏，最后受不了了自己花了几千块弄好了，但是也不保证下次啥时候漏。夏天都还好，开空调也凉快，但是冬天是真的冷，开空调都不顶事，尤其室外温度低的时候，只能再掏出来个电油汀之类的才好点，房间大了非得电费也多很多。</details></li><li>I live on the top floor. I can tolerate climbing the stairs, but it&#x27;s troublesome to buy things, especially large items. Transportation is too restricted. I was exhausted myself carrying a small table up. I&#x27;ve encountered leaks. The older the house, the easier it is to leak. Mine was at the rainwater pipe, but it didn&#x27;t leak into the house. The cold in winter and heat in summer are not obvious. Aside from that, it&#x27;s quiet, which is the main reason I bought it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我住顶楼。爬楼能忍受，买东西特别是大件比较麻烦，搬运太受限了，我自己买了个小桌子抬上来也累死。漏水遇到过，越老的房子越容易漏，我家是雨水管那里，不过没漏到家里。冬冷夏热感知不明显。除此以外就是安静，这一点也是我买的主要目的。</details></li><li>I need to buy a house urgently. I don&#x27;t want to rent here for another moment. I have to renew my lease soon and almost wavered. It still depends on the powerful V2EX website.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>买房迫在眉睫，这里一刻都不想租了。马上又得续租，差点就动摇了，还得是强大的 v 站。</details></li><li>Don&#x27;t buy it, even if the price is low. If the house isn&#x27;t too dilapidated, waterproofing can easily solve leak issues, but there&#x27;ll be many other problems. It&#x27;s extra hot in the summer, and extremely cold during winter. The extra electricity bill that you spend on AC&#x27;s could be have save you if you lived on a lower floor. When the water consumption is high during the summer, the water pressure is not enough, and the water flow is small. It&#x27;s exhausting carrying something, especially large appliances, upstairs. When ordering bottled water, the delivery person won&#x27;t come up, or they&#x27;ll charge extra. If I have to say an advantages, it&#x27;s the quietness. Basically, no one will bother you, not even a thief will bother to come up. If you can&#x27;t access the roof, it will be even more quite. You can&#x27;t hear other people&#x27;s footsteps or the sound of chair legs rubbing on the ground, or the sound of marbles falling on the ground. If the top floor can go up, it&#x27;s convenient to dry clothes and quilts, and some can even grow flowers and vegetables on it. You don&#x27;t have to worry about sewer blockage, even if it&#x27;s blocked, it won&#x27;t affect your house.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>别买，价格再低也别买。漏雨之类的只要是房子不是太破，做个防水问题不大但是其他缺点就多了去了。夏天特别热，动态特别冷；开空调多费的电费钱加上去可以换个低层了。夏天用水量大的时候水压不够，水特别小；买个东西尤其是大一点的家电啥的，拿上楼真的累死；定个桶装水，送水的师傅都不上，或者要加钱；非要说优点，也有安静，基本上没人打扰，小偷都懒得上来如果楼顶上不去，更安静，听不到别人的脚步声或者椅子腿地上摩擦的声音，也听不到弹珠掉在地上的声音如果顶楼可以上去，晒衣服被子方便，有的还可以在上面种种花草和蔬菜不怕下水道堵塞，堵了也殃及不到自己家</details></li><li>I don&#x27;t recommend buying the top floor: 1. There is a high probability of leaks and seepage. If there is no property repair fund, you have to pay for it yourself. If there is, it is very troublesome to get signatures from house to house. If some stubborn people don&#x27;t sign, you can only pay for it yourself. 2. It is too hot in summer. Some people lay a heat insulation layer on the roof, which also requires the permission of the property management. If it is not allowed, there is no solution. If there is a stubborn person in the same building who opposes it, there is basically no way.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>不建议买顶楼：1. 大概率漏水和渗水，物业维修金没有的话要自己出钱，有的话挨家挨户签名也很麻烦，万一有一些头铁不签名，只能自己掏钱。2.  夏天太热，有些人在楼顶铺隔热层，同样要经过物业允许，如果不允许就无解，如果有同栋头铁反对，基本没办法。</details></li><li>No elevator, strongly not recommended for old and dilapidated top floors. Roof leaks are difficult to deal with, and it&#x27;s not that you can just fix it if you have money. You don&#x27;t know when the next leak will come.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>没电梯，楼顶老破小强烈不建议。楼顶漏水很难搞的，不是说你有钱就可以。你不知道下次漏水会是什么时候到来。</details></li><li>I haven&#x27;t bought a house, but I&#x27;ve rented one in Beijing, and I&#x27;ve unfortunately had several times where the roof leaked, but I haven&#x27;t encountered it, because there is very little light rain in Beijing. It is certain that it&#x27;s warm in summer, and you can clearly feel the heat is from the sun. One needs to turn on air conditioning in the early morning. Winter is okay, Beijing heating is fine. The despair of climbing stairs, is okay for young people, but not for the elderly and children. Resale liquidity, of course, you see that you have posted.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我没买过房，但在北京租过房，很不幸好几次都是顶楼漏水倒没遇到，因为北京很少小雨夏暖是肯定的，很明显能感觉是那种晒出来的热，大早上就要开空调了。冬凉倒还好，北京暖气还行爬楼的绝望，年轻人还行，老人小孩真不行转手流通性，这个肯定，你看你自己都发帖了</details></li>
