            <p>Low screen dimming at 60hz with 800nit, single camera, no magsafe, no ultra-wideband, even uwb is cut (airtag unusable), A18 is still crippled, testing with C1 chip (without paying Qualcomm tax), comparing with devices from 4-5 years ago (iphone11 12), this kind of product is released in 2025 and sells for 4499, don&#x27;t know what Apple is thinking. Truly only apple can do.</p>

                <p>八百尼特六十赫兹之劣屏，暗光流转，伤及神识。单目摄魂，难窥大道。磁吸已逝，灵气溃散。超宽频无踪，大道难寻。纵UWB亦遭断绝，寻宝器无用武之地。A18芯片，气血亏损，再遭削弱。以C1测验，避高通之税，徒增笑耳。昔年之物（iphone11、12），竟敢比肩。至二零二五年，出此等拙劣之物，索价四千四百九十九，莫测苹果之意。真乃苹果独步天下，自甘堕落。</p>

Second, this pricing gives dealers a lot of room, and followed the national subsidy policy, from the risk point of view, is very good<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此甚妙。命名定价，皆为上策。购新不购旧，纵为十六E，亦属十六系，足慰攀比之心。众人不喜渺小，多慕宏大。定价予经销商以广阔之利，又合国补之策，避险益彰。</details></li><li>@bk201 Then please withdraw from the WTO first<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@bk201 阁下何不先退世贸？</details></li><li>We Apple also want to have our own Nova11🤣<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾辈苹果，亦欲拥 Nova11，岂不美哉？</details></li><li>@gogozs Why give bad things to parents?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@gogozs 何以将劣物赠予父母？</details></li><li>Apple&#x27;s official account specifically marked participation in the national subsidy, with an actual price of 3999😂<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>苹果官号特书国补，实价三千九百九十九，贻笑大方。</details></li><li>@laikick #8 Citation without source?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@laikick 引述不注来源？</details></li><li>The signal is good, the C1 signal is awesome, the signal is poor, the Huawei base station is garbage<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>信号若佳，则C1芯片功莫大焉；反之，华为基站皆为尘土。</details></li><li>@laikick #8 “This is a good thing”, consistent with the avatar<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@laikick 阁下所言“此乃好事”，与尊容甚符。</details></li><li>@bk201 Trump economics😂<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@bk201 川普经济学，闻所未闻。</details></li><li>I love to hear the scolding<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>善哉，此骂声吾甚喜之。</details></li><li>Unlocked for 899 in 2 years<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>二载之后，无锁售八百九十九。</details></li><li>Very good, even more useless things like SE1-3 can be sold, SE4 is not lacking in the market, 8G memory and a shutter button 😂<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>甚妙甚妙，SE1至3之流皆可售罄，SE4又岂惧乎？八千兆内存，快门键犹存，可叹可叹!。</details></li><li>16e is trash, but storage is gold.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>十六E虽为废品，然存储堪比黄金。</details></li><li>@bk201 The national subsidy is a &quot;consumption subsidy issued by the state&quot;, not a &quot;domestic subsidy&quot;. Apple pays so much tax in China every year, it is normal to participate in the national subsidy<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@bk201 国补乃“国家出台之消费补贴”，非“国产补贴”。苹果岁纳重税于华夏，参与国补亦属常理。</details></li><li>@bk201 Apple pays more taxes in the country than domestic companies, not to mention that Apple can get huge subsidies like Huawei. To revitalize domestic consumption, it never depends on you and me. To rely on red nobles and mysterious rich people willing to return to China to consume, this is the core.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@bk201 苹果于华夏纳税，远胜本土企业，且不得如华为般得巨额补贴。欲振兴内需，非你我蝇头之利，而在于巨贾贵族，愿归国消费，方为要义。</details></li><li>@bk201 Just force the removal of foreign brands<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@bk201 何不径直下架海外品牌？</details></li><li>op can&#x27;t escape the Qualcomm tax, patent licensing<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>高通之税，专利之授，无可遁逃。</details></li><li>@tunggt I am used to picking up second-hand goods on eBay, an SE3 picked up for $130 two or three years ago is very good for my mom. I just don’t know if it’s easy to modify the card on this machine, if you don’t have to move the motherboard, then it’s no problem. Strive to pick up an XR for $199 to replace my dad’s. This kind of machine is suitable for buying for the elderly, the cut things are not needed by the elderly, very good. I really don’t trust buying domestic Android.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@tunggt 吾惯于易趣网拾二手游，二三年前百三十刀购得SE3，予慈母用之甚佳。然不知此机改卡是否易，若不动主板，则无碍。再觅一百九十九刀之XR，以替家父之物。此等机器，适宜购与耆老，所砍之物，皆其所弃，善哉。至于安卓，吾实难信。</details></li><li>@tunggt What are you thinking, consumption depends on the &quot;masses&quot; rich people buy private jets, not as good as &quot;masses&quot; everyone has a 1000 yuan Redmi<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@tunggt 汝作何思？消费当赖“大众”，富人购私人飞机，不如“大众”人手一部千元红米。</details></li>
