            <p>After working at UFIDA for 5 years, 2 years in project operation and 3 years in sales operation support
At the beginning of the year, UFIDA started a major layoff plan. Internal factions were rampant. Standing on the wrong side, even with excellent employee performance, it felt useless.
The entire sub-industry is gone. Now I&#x27;m anxiously looking for a job and it&#x27;s really hard to adjust my mentality. I&#x27;m feeling depressed.
A bunch of recruiting software don&#x27;t reply.
Is there a chance here?

Mainly engaged in project operation and sales support in tob software companies
This is where developers come to apply for jobs. I wonder if a small role like my assistant can be picked up by a company

Let&#x27;s understand a few questions: 1. What is your education? 2. What is your age? 3.

Looking for a job is a recommendation from a friend or colleague, 2. One is to brush up your resume in the public market and say hello to others. Wait for the rabbit. If you feel that your resume is OK, is there anything else that needs to be improved, but you haven&#x27;t found it? 3. There is another way to take the initiative, go directly to the door<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@heyjany 勿以小人之心度君子之腹，謝！@jasdkasdjkas 一、親友薦舉，二、廣布履歷，守株待兔，若自覺履歷尚可，則必有未盡善之處，三、主動出擊，直叩門扉。</details></li><li>Change to other sales, such as selling Tesla.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>改弦更張，售特斯拉亦可。</details></li><li>You can switch to an industry with a future.
