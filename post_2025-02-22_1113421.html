            <h3>在用友做项目专员和销售运营支持被裁员，找工作是真难</h3>
        </details>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I stayed at Yonyou for 5 years, 2 years in project operations, and 3 years in sales operations support.
At the beginning of the year, Yonyou started a major layoff plan. Internal factions were rife, and it was useless to stand on the wrong side, even if you got excellent employee performance.
The entire sub-industry is gone. Now I&#x27;m anxiously looking for a job, and it&#x27;s really difficult to adjust my mentality. I&#x27;m depressed.
A bunch of recruiting software don&#x27;t reply.
Is there a chance here?

I have mainly been doing project operations and sales support in tob software companies.
Everyone here is a developer looking for a job. I don&#x27;t know if any company will pick up a small role like me.
Based in Shanghai</p>

                <p>在用友待了 5 年，2 年项目运营，3 年销售运营支持
年初用友开启大裁员计划，内部派系林立，站错队，即使拿了优秀员工绩效都 OK 感觉也没用
整个分行业没了，现在焦虑找工作 ing 心态真的难调节 整个人都抑郁了
招聘软件一堆不回复的
这里瞅瞅会有机会吗？

主要是一直在 tob 软件企业做项目运营和销售支持
这里都是开发来求职 不知道我这种助理小角色有公司捞一把吗

                <li>If you answer the questions on the 1st floor, you will be at a disadvantage! He is not recruiting, he will only laugh at you if you answer these questions. Just honestly use the job search software.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你要是回答 1 楼的问题，就落了下乘了！他又不招聘，你回答这些问题，他只会讥笑你。 老老实实刷招聘软件吧</details></li><li>It feels like it&#x27;s a problem with the industry. Domestic tob is just very poor.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>感觉是行业的问题，国内 tob 就是很穷逼</details></li><li>@jasdkasdjkas Finding a job is really difficult, I have a few questions to understand: 1. What is your education level? 2. What is your age? 3. What is the salary you are asking for?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@jasdkasdjkas 找工作是真难有几个问题了解下：1.你的学历是什么？2.你的年龄是什么？3.你要求的薪资是什么？</details></li><li>@cust2008 Bachelor&#x27;s degree, 35 years old, female, has a child, usually deals with delivery, development, and sales a lot, salary 10-12K a month, this requirement is actually not high.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@cust2008  本科 35 岁 性别女 有娃 平时主要是跟交付 开发 销售打交道比较多薪资 10-12K 一个月 这个要求其实不算高</details></li><li>Yonyou&#x27;s ERP market share is still quite large. Look for manufacturing factories?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>用友的 erp 市场占有量还是蛮大的 找找制造类工厂之类的？</details></li><li>Is your position pre-sales technical support? Some companies have their own exclusive job titles, but there are relatively unified job titles in the industry.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你的岗位定位属于售前技术支持吗。有的公司会有自己专属的岗位名称，但是行业内还是有比较统一的岗位名称的。</details></li><li>@heyjany I&#x27;m anxious from refreshing, I&#x27;ll look at all the platforms, just give me a job, I don&#x27;t care about anything else. When I get anxious, my condition is terrible. I have a mortgage and a child to raise. I have to bow my head to life.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@heyjany 刷的焦虑了，各个平台都会看  给个工作就行 其他无所谓了 焦虑起来状态太差劲了有房贷 有娃要养 得向生活低头</details></li><li>@heyjany Please don&#x27;t judge a gentleman with the heart of a villain, thank you! @jasdkasdjkas 1. A friend or colleague recommends a job. 2. One is to refresh the resume in the open market and say hello to others, waiting for the rabbits. You feel that the resume is OK, but is there anything else that needs to be improved, but you haven&#x27;t found it? 3. There is also an active attack, just go directly to the door.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@heyjany 请不要以小人之心度君子之腹 谢谢！@jasdkasdjkas 1. 找工作一种朋友或同事推荐，2. 一个在公开市场刷简历和别人打招呼 守株待兔，你自己感觉简历 OK ，那是不是还有其他地方需要完善，只是你没有发现3. 还有一种是主动出击哈，直接找上门</details></li><li>Switch to another sales job, such as selling Teslas.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>换个其他的销售，比如卖特斯拉</details></li><li>You can switch to an industry with a future. If you focus on your past experience to find a related industry, you will face the same problem in a few years. Or go to a related upstream or downstream industry and lie flat.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>可以转行去个有未来的行业。如果盯着自己过往经历找个相关行业，过几年会面临现在一样的问题。或者去个上下游的相关行业躺平。</details></li><li>@leonlx Yeah, thank you, that&#x27;s exactly the situation. I also tried searching for some related keywords, but I got depressed from using job search software. I came here to complain and try my luck.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@leonlx 嗯 谢谢确实是这么个情况 也尝试搜一些相关的关键词 就是刷招聘软件抑郁了 这个里面来吐吐槽 碰碰运气 w</details></li><li>First, apply for ERP-related jobs, and also try other 2b industries. Don&#x27;t listen to those cynical remarks, just apply widely and get a job first.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>先投 ERP 相关的，其他 2b 的行业也都试试，别听那些冷嘲热讽的，先海投海面有个饭碗再说。</details></li><li>I have a question, what communication forums are used for sales operations?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>请教个问题，销售运营用哪些交流论坛</details></li><li>@jasdkasdjkas The market is like this. Our company&#x27;s marketing positions no longer recruit women. They can&#x27;t drink and have to take care of their children. If they arrange for a second or third child, they will be supported for half a year for nothing.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@jasdkasdjkas 市场就是这样的，我们公司营销岗已经不招女的了，又不能喝又要照顾孩子，万一再安排二胎三胎，白养半年。</details></li><li>@heyjany Fortunately, they didn&#x27;t ask to report bust, waist, and hip measurements and weight. 😁<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@heyjany 还好没要求报三围体重😁</details></li><li>@wnpllrzodiac Bitter smile, you can say anything when you don&#x27;t have a job.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@wnpllrzodiac 苦笑 没工作你说啥都行</details></li><li>PMO?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>PMO 吗？</details></li><li>She can only be said to be a PMO member.

In such a large environment, you have to learn to adjust your mentality. It&#x27;s not worth it if you can&#x27;t find a job and your body has problems.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>如果说不急那是假的，但回过头来看真别太焦虑，大环境如此要学着调心态，工作不成身体出了问题得不偿失不是、</details></li><li>@mwftts Shanghai<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@mwftts 上海</details></li>
