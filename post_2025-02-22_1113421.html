        <h1>Laid off from Yonyou as a project specialist and sales operations support, it's really hard to find a job</h1>
        <h2>在用友做项目专员和销售运营支持被裁员，找工作是真难</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I have been in Yonyou for 5 years, 2 years of project operations and 3 years of sales operations support.
At the beginning of the year, Yonyou launched a major layoff plan. There are many internal factions. Standing on the wrong team, even if you get excellent employee performance, it feels useless.
The entire sub-industry is gone, and now I am anxious about finding a job. It is really difficult to adjust my mentality and I feel depressed.
A bunch of recruitment software doesn’t reply.
Is there a chance to take a look here?

Mainly been doing project operation and sales support in tob software companies
Developers are all here to apply for jobs. I don’t know if any company will pick up a small assistant like me.

            <p>在用友待了 5 年，2 年项目运营，3 年销售运营支持
年初用友开启大裁员计划，内部派系林立，站错队，即使拿了优秀员工绩效都 OK 感觉也没用
整个分行业没了，现在焦虑找工作 ing 心态真的难调节 整个人都抑郁了
招聘软件一堆不回复的
这里瞅瞅会有机会吗？

主要是一直在 tob 软件企业做项目运营和销售支持
这里都是开发来求职 不知道我这种助理小角色有公司捞一把吗

                <li>If you answer the question on the 1st floor, you will be at a disadvantage! He is not recruiting, and if you answer these questions, he will only laugh at you. Honestly, just keep using the recruitment software.<br>你要是回答 1 楼的问题，就落了下乘了！他又不招聘，你回答这些问题，他只会讥笑你。 老老实实刷招聘软件吧</li><li>I feel it's an industry problem. Domestic tob is very poor.<br>感觉是行业的问题，国内 tob 就是很穷逼</li><li>@jasdkasdjkas It's really hard to find a job. I have a few questions to understand: 1. What is your education? 2. What is your age? 3. What is your salary requirement?<br>@jasdkasdjkas 找工作是真难有几个问题了解下：1.你的学历是什么？2.你的年龄是什么？3.你要求的薪资是什么？</li><li>@cust2008 Bachelor degree, 35 years old, female, has children. Usually deals with delivery, development and sales. The salary is 10-12K a month. This requirement is not too high.<br>@cust2008  本科 35 岁 性别女 有娃 平时主要是跟交付 开发 销售打交道比较多薪资 10-12K 一个月 这个要求其实不算高</li><li>Yonyou's ERP market share is still quite large. Look for manufacturing factories, etc.?<br>用友的 erp 市场占有量还是蛮大的 找找制造类工厂之类的？</li><li>Is your position defined as presales technical support? Some companies have their own exclusive job titles, but there are relatively unified job titles in the industry.<br>你的岗位定位属于售前技术支持吗。有的公司会有自己专属的岗位名称，但是行业内还是有比较统一的岗位名称的。</li><li>@heyjany I'm anxious about using the recruitment software. I look at all the platforms. Just give me a job, I don’t care about anything else. When I get anxious, my condition is too bad. I have a mortgage and children to raise, so I have to bow to life.<br>@heyjany 刷的焦虑了，各个平台都会看  给个工作就行 其他无所谓了 焦虑起来状态太差劲了有房贷 有娃要养 得向生活低头</li><li>@heyjany Please don't judge others by your own standards. Thank you! @jasdkasdjkas 1. Finding a job through friends or colleagues' recommendations, 2. Applying for jobs and greeting people in the open market is like waiting for a rabbit. You feel that your resume is OK, then are there other aspects that need to be improved, but you haven't discovered it? 3. There is also a way to take the initiative and go directly to the door.<br>@heyjany 请不要以小人之心度君子之腹 谢谢！@jasdkasdjkas 1. 找工作一种朋友或同事推荐，2. 一个在公开市场刷简历和别人打招呼 守株待兔，你自己感觉简历 OK ，那是不是还有其他地方需要完善，只是你没有发现3. 还有一种是主动出击哈，直接找上门</li><li>Switch to other sales, such as selling Tesla.<br>换个其他的销售，比如卖特斯拉</li><li>You can switch to an industry with a future. If you stare at your past experience to find a related industry, you will face the same problems in a few years. Or go to a related upstream and downstream industry and lie flat.<br>可以转行去个有未来的行业。如果盯着自己过往经历找个相关行业，过几年会面临现在一样的问题。或者去个上下游的相关行业躺平。</li><li>@leonlx Yes, thank you, that's really the case. I also tried to search for some related keywords, but I got depressed while using the recruitment software. I came here to complain and try my luck.<br>@leonlx 嗯 谢谢确实是这么个情况 也尝试搜一些相关的关键词 就是刷招聘软件抑郁了 这个里面来吐吐槽 碰碰运气 w</li><li>First apply for ERP-related jobs, and also try other 2b industries. Don't listen to those cynical remarks, just apply to a lot of jobs and get a job first.<br>先投 ERP 相关的，其他 2b 的行业也都试试，别听那些冷嘲热讽的，先海投海面有个饭碗再说。</li><li>Please advise, what communication forums are used for sales operations?<br>请教个问题，销售运营用哪些交流论坛</li><li>@jasdkasdjkas The market is like this. Our company's marketing positions no longer recruit women. They can't drink and have to take care of their children. If they arrange for a second or third child, they will be supported for half a year for nothing.<br>@jasdkasdjkas 市场就是这样的，我们公司营销岗已经不招女的了，又不能喝又要照顾孩子，万一再安排二胎三胎，白养半年。</li><li>@heyjany Fortunately, they didn't ask for bust, waist and hip measurements and weight 😁<br>@heyjany 还好没要求报三围体重😁</li><li>@wnpllrzodiac Bitter smile, without a job, you can say anything.<br>@wnpllrzodiac 苦笑 没工作你说啥都行</li><li>PMO?<br>PMO 吗？</li><li>She can only be said to be a PMO member, in which city is the poster?<br>她这个只能说是 PMO 成员，楼主在哪个城市？</li><li>It's false to say that you are not in a hurry, but looking back, don't be too anxious. The general environment is like this, so you have to learn to adjust your mentality. If you don't get a job and your health problems arise, it will be a greater loss, right?<br>如果说不急那是假的，但回过头来看真别太焦虑，大环境如此要学着调心态，工作不成身体出了问题得不偿失不是、</li><li>@mwftts Shanghai<br>@mwftts 上海</li>
