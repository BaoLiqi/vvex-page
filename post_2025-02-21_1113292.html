        <div class="content">
            <p>There have been many posts about betrothal gifts recently, so as a person who has been there, I would like to give you some advice (as a negative example).

Let&#x27;s talk about my own situation first:
1. My wife is from a mountainous area in a famous betrothal gift province, her parents work away from home, and there are 3 daughters in the family.
2. My family is from Hebei, my parents are employees in the system, and I am an only child.
3. My wife and I married out of free love. My wife graduated with a PhD, and her tuition during college was a student loan, which she paid off slowly after graduation.
4. My family bought a wedding house in Beijing and added my wife&#x27;s name to it.
5. I firmly refused the sky-high betrothal gift (I didn&#x27;t have the money to give the sky-high betrothal gift after buying the house), and my wife was also very insistent, so her parents finally compromised (but still asked for about 100,000 yuan in gift money in other names).
6. Dowry of 0 yuan. Don&#x27;t even think about the woman helping to decorate the house or buy a car. Not a penny.

Don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the end of it. I used to think that I was marrying my wife, and I didn&#x27;t care about her family. However, I was too naive, and there were a lot of unhappy things waiting behind:
1. Don&#x27;t think that you bought a house in Beijing and added the woman&#x27;s name, and your economic level crushes them, and you treat their daughter well, you will win respect, thinking that you are marrying a dragon? As far as the father-in-law and mother-in-law are concerned, if you don&#x27;t give a betrothal gift, you owe them a sum of money, and they will always ignore you and never treat you as family.
2. Relatives (father-in-law, mother-in-law, sister-in-law) come to Beijing and never pay a penny themselves, and they will try to get as much as they can from us. Round-trip travel expenses, food, drink, and accommodation are all actively requested to be paid by us, and as much as possible, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to spend our money, and there is even a sense of pleasure, spending it is earning it. They would rather take a plane than a high-speed train, and even actively ask to buy first-class seats. Let me put it this way, I have never seen her family&#x27;s payment code, and they never pay when I am around.
3. When they come to their daughter&#x27;s house, they always come empty-handed and take a big bag of things away. My wife&#x27;s sister takes whatever she likes.
4. You have to give gifts to the father-in-law&#x27;s family during the holidays, but they never give red envelopes to their granddaughter. Over the years, the money spent by my wife&#x27;s parents on their child does not exceed a few hundred yuan in total.
5. When I went back to my wife&#x27;s hometown, a large group of &quot;relatives&quot; came. The mother-in-law said that according to their customs, everyone (not only children, but also uncles and aunts in their 50s and 60s) should give red envelopes, and a banquet should be held to entertain them (the cost is naturally covered by us).
6. The mother-in-law hinted that the money they usually give them is too little...

Things like this are not big deals at the moment, but there is really nothing happy about it.

My wife and I have a good relationship, so I chose to get married.
When I think back to it in the dead of night, it is really tiring, helpless, and stupid to get along with such a family.
Always paying and always giving, but there is no response, just like a bottomless pit.

The purpose of posting is to tell those who are not yet married, and those who are struggling, especially those brothers who have been posting recently, whether you can accept these things, and consider carefully. I didn&#x27;t expect it at the time anyway.</p>

                <p>近日，论及聘礼者众，故以过来者之鉴，警醒诸位道友（反例）。

先述吾家境况：

1.  妻乃某聘礼大省山区之人，双亲劳作于外，家有三女。
2.  吾家乃河北人士，父母皆为体制内，独子。
3.  吾与妻自由相恋而结缡。妻乃博士毕业，大学期间之学费皆为助学贷款，毕业之后，方才慢慢偿还。
4.  吾家于燕京购得婚房一处，并加妻之名。
5.  吾坚拒天价聘礼（置房之后，囊中羞涩），加之吾妻亦执意不允，最终其父母亦只能作罢（然仍以其他名义索要纹银十万两）。
6.  嫁妆为零。欲其女家襄助装修之事，莫之敢想。一文不予。

切莫以为此事已毕。曾几时，吾亦以为，吾娶妻，于其家室，吾且漠视之。然则，大谬矣，往后尚有诸多不悦之事等候：

1.  莫以为于燕京置得房产，并加之女方之名，经济实力碾压之，且待其女甚好，便可赢得敬重，自以为乘龙快婿？于老丈人丈母娘而言，未曾予之聘礼，便是歉其一笔债，永世皆爱答不理，永不以汝为家人视之。
2.  其母家之人（丈人、丈母娘、小姨子）至燕京，从不自掏腰包，能多啃噬吾等一分，便欲得一分。往返路费，饮食拉撒，皆主动要求吾等掏钱，且务必多掏，花吾等之钱不心疼，甚至略有快感，花到便是赚到。宁可乘坐飞机，亦不愿乘坐高铁，甚至主动要求购得一等座。简而言之，吾从未见其母家之人出示付款码，有吾在之场合，从不掏钱。
3.  至其女家，每次皆是空着手来，背负一大包物品而归。吾妻之妹，见有心仪之物，皆携之而去。
4.  逢年过节，必得予丈人家送礼，然则，彼等从不予外孙女红包。孩儿这些年，外公外婆所耗之资，总共不超过几百纹银。
5.  归吾妻老家，来了一大堆“亲戚”，丈母娘云，按照彼等之风俗，人皆须赠红包，并且务必设宴款待之。（用度一应皆由吾等承担).
6.  丈母娘暗示，平时予彼等之财物太少矣。

诸如此类，实则现下来说，皆非何等出格之大事，然则，确乎几无开心之事。

吾与吾妻情感甚笃，故选而结婚。

夜深之时，回首思之，与此等家室相处，实在疲惫不堪，甚是无奈，何其愚蠢。

永远在付出，永远在给予，然则却几无回应，宛如无底之洞。

发帖之用意，便是为告诫尚未结婚者，以及正在纠结者，特别是近来于此发帖之诸位道友，汝等能否接受此事，慎重考虑之为上。反正当时吾未曾料及。</p>

Is she indifferent and has no reaction at all?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>汝妻对此事作何感想？漠然处之，毫无反应乎？</details></li><li>After reading the post, I probably know that the poster and his wife must have a good relationship, and both sides are relatively helpless about this kind of thing. For the poster&#x27;s family, money is definitely not a lot, but the problem is that it is a bit disgusting. If you spend money and get a smile or a warm attitude, you will feel more comfortable. No one&#x27;s money comes from the wind, and everyone will be unhappy if they always take it out like this. What should I say when I encounter this kind of thing? There is definitely no way to break up directly, after all, the matter has not risen to that level, I can only say try to reduce contact as much as possible, the focus is still on my own little life, if one day I want to lift the table, I will say it (and the wife unified the front). ..<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>观帖知之，楼主夫妻情深，对此无奈。于楼主家而言，金钱非大数，然事颇膈应。若使钱财，得笑颜热情，心方安。钱莫非大风所至，如此倾囊，心焉能平。事已至此，断难决裂，毕竟未至此地步，唯有少往来，重心在己。若他日需掀桌，与妻统一战线便是。。。</details></li><li>It is recommended that OP communicate with his wife, explain his thoughts, and see what her attitude is.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>建议楼主同妻沟通，陈述己见，观其态度。</details></li><li>It&#x27;s not about the betrothal gift, it&#x27;s about you marrying a country person, that&#x27;s how it is. Country people understand that when a daughter gets married, she is someone else&#x27;s family, so they want to collect a sum of money. City people, working-class families, how can there be a betrothal gift, the key is the housing problem.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>非关聘礼，乃尔娶乡野之人，故为是况。乡野之人以为，女既出嫁，便为他人之室，故欲得一笔钱财。城内之人，工薪之家，聘礼安在乎哉，关键在于房产。</details></li><li>I think the problem is with your wife. This post also reminds everyone to be sure to discuss with your partner before marriage, to deal with your parents for each other and for your small family, and to reject unreasonable demands. This matter can only be dealt with by your own parents, and it is easy to hurt feelings if the other party comes. Generally speaking, hurting feelings with your own parents is still a family affair in the end. Conversely, if you turn your back on each other because of this, it is best not to have any contact.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾以为问题在于汝妻。此帖亦警醒诸位，务必于婚前与道侣商议妥当，为彼此、为小家，搞定自家父母，拒之理。此乃自家父母方可搞定，若使对方来之，易伤感情。总而言之，与自家父母伤感情，终归亲人。反之，若因此翻脸者，则莫要往来。</details></li><li>Brother, you thought you didn&#x27;t give a betrothal gift, so people are like this, and you are reflecting on it? You gave a betrothal gift and people are like this. I have 0 betrothal gifts, and my father-in-law is very satisfied with me. Before the marriage, my grandmother said not to ask for a betrothal gift, so that people would look down on me, so they didn&#x27;t ask for it. The two of them are embarrassed to spend the night here, and every time I go to their place, I don&#x27;t have to do anything, which makes me feel embarrassed. Every time I go, I bring a lot of things...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>道友，汝以为未予聘礼，他人方才如此，且反躬自省？汝赠之聘礼，他人亦如是也。吾聘礼为零，老丈人甚为满意，婚前，吾奶奶云，莫要彩礼，免教人轻视，故未索要。彼二人至吾处，皆不好意思过夜，吾每次至彼处，皆无事可做，实感不安。每次皆带诸多玩物…</details></li><li>In his eyes, your family has a lot of money, but you just don&#x27;t want to take it out. Try to help your wife not to be kidnapped by her original family, have more contact with the man&#x27;s family, and when you go to the woman&#x27;s family, you pretend to be a fool, an ignorant son-in-law.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>在其眼中，汝家财大气粗，却不愿拿出分毫。当想法帮助汝妻，免其为原生家庭所裹挟，宜多与男家往来，至女方家中，则佯作愚钝，不谙世事之婿便可。</details></li><li>&quot;Especially those brothers who have been posting recently, whether you can accept these things, consider carefully.&quot; In fact, this is meaningless. Taking the poster as an example, if the poster opened the eyes of the sky and knew all the future, would you give up your other half? The combination of two families is inevitably the combination of two complex vector sets. You cannot deny the whole thing because of a certain point, or a certain negative reason. By the same token, it is said that a trivial conflict of values leads to the disintegration of two families. This is just an excuse for the two families to part ways.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>“特别是最近那些发帖的兄弟，汝等能否接受此事，慎重考虑。”实则此毫无意义。若以楼主为例，假设楼主得天眼，知晓之后之种种，尔便放弃汝之伴侣乎？两个家庭之结合，必然是两个复杂向量集之结合。汝不可因某一点，或某方面之负面原因而否定全盘。同理，号称因某一个细节之三观冲突，便导致两个家庭分崩离析。此不过乃双方家庭分道扬镳之托辞耳。</details></li><li>Will it affect the relationship between husband and wife in the long run<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>长此以往，岂不影响夫妻关系？</details></li><li>It feels terrible to watch<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>观之甚觉心烦意乱</details></li><li>PhD, Beijing, your income is much greater than theirs.
