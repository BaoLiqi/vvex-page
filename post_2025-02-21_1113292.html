        <div class="content">
            <p>Recently, there have been many posts about betrothal gifts. As someone who has been through it, I would like to provide a reference for everyone (a negative example).

Let&#x27;s talk about my situation first:
1 My wife is from a mountainous area in a famous betrothal gift province. Her parents are migrant workers, and there are 3 daughters in the family.
2 My family is in Hebei, my parents are employed in public institutions, and I am an only child.
3 My wife and I married for love. My wife has a doctorate. Her tuition during college was all student loans, which she paid off slowly after graduation.
4 My family bought a wedding house in Beijing and added my wife&#x27;s name to it.
5 I resolutely refused the exorbitant betrothal gift (I had no money to give the sky-high betrothal gift after buying the house), and my wife also insisted on it. Finally, her parents compromised (but still asked for about 100,000 yuan in gift money under other names).
6 The dowry was 0 yuan. Don&#x27;t even think about the woman&#x27;s family helping to decorate the house or buy a car. We didn&#x27;t get a penny.

Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s over. I used to think that I was marrying my wife and didn&#x27;t care about her family. However, I was too naive. There were a bunch of unhappy things waiting:
1 Don&#x27;t think that you bought a house in Beijing and added the woman&#x27;s name, and that your economic level is crushing them. Being nice to their daughter means you will win respect and become a son-in-law they respect? As far as the father-in-law and mother-in-law are concerned, if you don&#x27;t give a betrothal gift, you owe them money. They will never be interested in you and will never regard you as family.
2 When the wife&#x27;s family (father-in-law, mother-in-law, sister-in-law) comes to Beijing, they never pay a penny themselves, and try to take as much as they can from us. Round-trip travel expenses, food, drink, and everything else are all paid for by us at their initiative, and they try to spend as much as possible. They don&#x27;t feel bad spending our money, and even feel a sense of pleasure, feeling spending is earning. They would rather take a plane than a high-speed train, and even take the initiative to ask to buy first-class seats. Let me put it this way, I have never seen their family&#x27;s payment code. They never pay when I am around.
3 They always come empty-handed to their daughter&#x27;s house and leave with a big bag of things. My wife&#x27;s younger sister takes whatever she likes.
4 During festivals, we have to give gifts to the wife&#x27;s family, but they never give red envelopes to their granddaughter. Over the years, the grandparents have spent less than a few hundred yuan on the child.
5 When we returned to my wife&#x27;s hometown, a large group of &quot;relatives&quot; came. My mother-in-law said that according to their customs, everyone (not only children, but also uncles and aunts in their fifties and sixties) had to give red envelopes, and we had to have a banquet to entertain them (we naturally covered all the expenses).
6 My mother-in-law hinted that the money we usually give them is too little...

Things like this are not outrageous, but there is also almost nothing happy.

I have a good relationship with my wife, so I chose to get married.
When I look back on it late at night, it is really tiring, helpless, and stupid to get along with such a family.
Forever giving and giving, but there is no response, like a bottomless pit.

The purpose of posting is to tell those who are not yet married, and those who are hesitating, especially the brothers who have been posting recently, to consider carefully whether you can accept these things. I didn&#x27;t expect it at the time.</p>

                <p>最近聊彩礼的帖子很多，作为过来人给大家做个参考（反面案例）。

先说说自己情况：
1 老婆来自某著名彩礼省的山区，父母打工，家里 3 个女儿。
2 我家河北，父母体制内职工，独生子。
3 我和我老婆自由恋爱结婚。我老婆博士毕业，大学期间的学费都是助学贷款，工作后自己慢慢还掉的。
4 我家在北京买了一套婚房，加了我老婆名字。
5 我坚决拒绝天价彩礼（我买房后也没钱给天价彩礼），加上我老婆意见也很坚持，最终她父母妥协（但还是以其他名义要了大约十万块礼钱）。
6 嫁妆 0 元。女方帮装修房子、买车这种事更是想都别想。一毛钱都没得。

不要以为这就完事了。曾经我也以为，我是跟我老婆结婚，对于她的家庭我不在乎。然鹅，还是太天真了，后面还有一堆不开心的事等着：
1 不要以为你买了套北京的房子加了女方名字，经济水平碾压他们，对他们女儿好，就会赢得尊重，以为自己乘龙快婿？对老丈人丈母娘而言，你没给彩礼，就是欠他们一笔钱，永远都对你爱答不理，永远不会把你当家人看待。
2 娘家人（丈人、丈母娘、小姨子）来北京，从不自己掏一分钱，能多啃我们一点就啃一点。往返路费，吃喝拉撒，都是主动要求让我们掏钱，而且是尽量多掏钱，花我们的钱不心疼，甚至还有种快感，花到就是赚到。能坐飞机绝不坐高铁，甚至主动要求买一等座。这么说吧，我从没见过她娘家人的付款码，有我在的场合从来不掏。
3 来女儿家，每次都是空着手来，背一大包东西走。我老婆的妹妹看上什么好带什么走。
4 逢年过节得给丈人家送礼，但他们从来不给外孙女红包。小孩这些年，外公外婆花的钱总共不超过几百块。
5 回我老婆老家，来了一大堆“亲戚”，丈母娘说按照他们的风俗，每个人（不仅小孩子，五六十岁的大爷大妈）都要给红包，并且要摆酒席宴请他们（费用自然是我们全包）。
6 丈母娘暗示平常给他们的钱太少了。。。

诸如此类，其实目前来说都不是什么出格的大事，但确实也几乎没什么开心的事。

我跟我老婆感情很好，所以我选择了结婚。
夜深人静的时候回过头想想，跟这样的家庭相处真的很累，很无奈，很傻逼。
永远在付出，永远在给予，但是没有什么回应，就好像无底洞。

发帖的目的就是告诉还没结婚的，以及正在纠结的，特别是最近那些发帖的兄弟，你能不能接受这些事情，慎重考虑。我反正当时是没想到的。</p>

                <li>Don&#x27;t give, don&#x27;t receive, don&#x27;t pay attention, will they break your bones and eat them? You asked for it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>不给，不接待，不理睬，会把你骨头拆散吃了么？你这自找的呀</details></li><li>Scary bro, but your current tolerance is worthy of respect 🫡<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吓人老哥，但你当下的包容值得尊敬🫡</details></li><li>What does your wife think of these things? Is she indifferent and has no reaction at all?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你老婆怎么看这些事呢，无动于衷一点反应也没有吗？</details></li><li>After reading the post, I roughly know that the poster and his wife must have a very good relationship, and both of them are relatively helpless about this kind of thing. For families like the poster, the money is certainly not much, but the problem is that it is a bit disgusting. If you can get a smile or an enthusiastic attitude after spending the money, then you will feel better at least. No one&#x27;s money comes from the wind, and everyone will be unhappy if they always take it out like this. What to say when encountering this kind of thing, there is certainly no way to break up directly, after all, the matter has not escalated to that level, only to say try to have less contact, the focus is still on your own small life, if one day you want to turn the table, then talk about it (unite with your wife)...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>看完帖子大概就知道了，楼主和老婆肯定是感情很好的，而且双方对这种事也比较无奈，对楼主这种家庭来说，钱肯定不算多，但问题是有点膈应人。钱花了如果能有个笑脸或者热情的态度，那起码心里会舒服点。谁的钱都不是大风刮来的，总是这么往外掏谁都会不爽。遇到这种事咋说呢，肯定也没办法直接闹掰，毕竟事情没上升到那么大，只能说尽量少来往吧，重点还是自己的小日子，如果哪天要掀桌了再说吧（和老婆统一战线就好）。。。</details></li><li>I suggest OP communicate with his wife, explain his thoughts, and see what her attitude is.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>建议 OP 和老婆沟通一下，说明自己的想法，看她是个什么态度。</details></li><li>It&#x27;s not about the betrothal gift, it&#x27;s that you married a rural person, and that&#x27;s how it is. Rural people understand that when their daughter gets married, she is someone else&#x27;s person, so they have to collect a sum of money. City people, working-class families, there is no such thing as a betrothal gift, the key is the house problem.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>不是彩礼不彩礼，是你和乡下人结婚，那就是这样的。乡下人理解的女儿出嫁，就是别人家的人了，所以要收一笔钱。城里人，工人阶级家庭，哪有彩礼一说，关键是房子问题。</details></li><li>I think the problem lies with your wife. This post also reminds everyone to discuss with their partner before marriage and to settle their parents for each other and for their own small family, and reject unreasonable demands. This matter can only be settled by your own parents, and it is easy to hurt feelings if the other party comes forward. Generally speaking, hurting feelings with your own parents will ultimately be relatives. Conversely, if you turn your face because of this, then it&#x27;s best not to interact.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我觉得这个问题出在你老婆。在这个帖子也提醒一下各位，一定要在婚前和对象商量好，要为对方，为自己的小家庭搞定自己父母，拒绝不合理的要求。  这个事情，只能是自己的父母自己搞定，对方来的话，容易伤感情。自己父母一般来说伤感情也终归是亲人。反过来说，如果因为这个就翻脸的，那就最好别往来了。</details></li><li>Bro, you thought they were like this because you didn&#x27;t give a betrothal gift, and you&#x27;re reflecting on it? They would be like this even if you gave a betrothal gift. I had 0 betrothal gift, and my father-in-law is very satisfied with me. Before the wedding, grandmother said not to ask for a betrothal gift, so that people would look down on us, and they didn&#x27;t ask for anything. The old couple are embarrassed to stay overnight when they come to my place. Every time I go to their place, I don&#x27;t have to do anything, which makes me feel embarrassed. Every time I go, I bring a lot of things...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>哥们，你以为你没给彩礼人家这样，还反思的？你给了彩礼人家也这样。我 0 彩礼，老丈人对我很满意，结婚前人奶奶就说别要彩礼，让人家看不起，人家就都没要。她们老两口来我这都不好意思过夜，我每次去他们那都啥啥不用干，弄得我都怪不好意思的，每次去都带不少东西...</details></li><li>In their eyes, your family has a lot of money, but you just don&#x27;t take it out. Try to help your wife not to be kidnapped by her original family, have more contact with the man&#x27;s family, and pretend to be a fool when you go to the woman&#x27;s family, and you&#x27;ll get an ignorant son-in-law.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>在他眼里你家有的是钱，只是不掏出来罢了想办法帮助你老婆别被原生家庭绑架，多与男方家来往，去女方家你就装作傻冒，不懂事的女婿得了</details></li><li>&quot;Especially those brothers who have been posting recently, can you accept these things, consider carefully&quot; In fact, this doesn&#x27;t make much sense. Taking the poster as an example, suppose the poster opened his heavenly eye and knew all the future events, would you give up your other half? The combination of two families is inevitably the combination of two complex vector sets. You cannot deny the whole because of a certain point or a negative reason in one aspect. By the same token, the claim that a conflict of values ​​in a certain detail leads to the collapse of two families. This point is just an excuse for the two families to part ways.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>“特别是最近那些发帖的兄弟，你能不能接受这些事情，慎重考虑”其实这没什么意义，以楼主为例，假设楼主开了天眼，知道了日后的种种，你就放弃你的另一半了？两个家庭的结合，必然都是两个复杂向量集的结合。你不可能因为某一点，或者某一方面的负面原因而否定全盘。同理，号称因为某一个细节的三观冲突，就导致两个家庭分崩离析。这一点也只是双方家庭分道扬镳的借口而已。</details></li><li>Will this affect the relationship between husband and wife in the long run?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>长期以往，不会影响夫妻关系吗</details></li><li>It feels terrible just looking at it<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>看着都觉得糟心</details></li><li>Doctor, Beijing, your income is much greater than theirs. I think spending a few thousand a year for your wife&#x27;s family is not much.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>博士，北京，你们的收入远大于他们我觉得一年花几千给你老婆家算少的</details></li><li>My girlfriend is also from Jiangxi.

Did you ever think about respecting your wife? Doesn&#x27;t the wife have the obligation to support the elderly? There are too many people like this on v site. In the family, you demand equality everywhere. If you&#x27;re so tired, don&#x27;t get married.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>自私又小气的人，选择了就接受，磨磨唧唧。 丝毫没有想过尊重下妻子，妻子没有瞻仰老人的义务？ v 站这种人太多了，再家庭里面，处处要求平等，这么累就不要结婚。</details></li><li>The woman should be the one to receive and handle the people and things on her family&#x27;s side.
