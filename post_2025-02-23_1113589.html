            <p>1. Family economic situation:
I currently have over 200,000 in hand.
My parents, older brother, and younger sister are currently living in a dilapidated house.
My parents are older (50s), and my father doesn&#x27;t want to work anymore because he says he&#x27;s too old to do so.
My older brother was born in 1995, is not yet married, and has no money.
2. Father&#x27;s request:
My father wants me to pay for building a house in our hometown.
I don&#x27;t want to pay for building a house; I want to buy a house in the city and am currently saving for a down payment.
I believe that I will need a house, car, and betrothal gifts for future marriage, and I will have to bear these costs myself.
My parents cannot provide financial support and may ask me for money in the future.
3. Concerns about building a house in the hometown:
Even if a new house is built, it will most likely be given to my older brother.
If all my savings are spent on building a house in the hometown, my plan to buy a house in the city will be affected.
I&#x27;m worried that even if the house in the hometown is built, the other party may not be satisfied when I get married in the future, and I may still have to rely on buying a house in the city myself.
4. Source of pressure:
I feel a lot of pressure because I need to independently bear major expenses such as buying a house and getting married. My parents may also ask me for money to live on.
Actually, I also don&#x27;t want to get married a bit. I&#x27;m very desperate right now. Should I build a house in my hometown, or follow my own ideas and buy a house in the city myself? I hope experienced people can give me some advice. Am I very selfish? I&#x27;m so sad that I have to bear so many things. It&#x27;s also because I was stupid when I just graduated and showed off to my parents that my salary was over 10,000. I hope my mother can be happier, but my father thinks I&#x27;m super amazing. In fact, I&#x27;m just a workhorse and worry about being laid off all the time.</p>

                <p>一、家况： 囊中尚有薄资二十万。 父母兄妹，蜗居旧宅之内。 父母年逾半百，父不欲再劳作，云年迈力衰矣。兄生于九五，未娶，且囊空如洗。 二、父之所求： 父欲吾出资，于乡野筑新居。 吾不愿为此，心仪城中之所，正积攒首付灵石。 以为他日婚娶，需楼阁、宝车、聘礼，皆须自力承担。 父母无力相助， 或他日尚需吾奉养。 三、虑及乡居之事： 纵使新庐落成， 大抵亦予兄长。 若倾囊于乡野筑室， 则于城中置业之计，恐受阻碍。 忧虑纵新居已成，他日婚时，或仍难悦佳人， 终须于城中觅佳所。 四、压力之源：倍感压力如山，盖因购居、婚娶诸事皆需独立承担。 父母或亦需吾奉养，以资度日。 实则，吾亦稍有不欲婚娶之念。 今心绪茫然， 究竟应于乡野筑室， 抑或按己所愿，于城中购居？ 望过来者能予一二箴言。 吾是否过于自私？ 甚是难过， 需承担如许多事。亦怪当年初入尘世，愚钝，向椿萱炫耀工薪过万。 愿萱堂能稍开颜，然椿庭则视吾为盖世奇才。 实则吾不过一牛马而已，时时忧虑被弃之危矣。</p>

This family environment looks like a bottomless pit...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>莫若为恶人，先思己身。此家境观之，如无底洞渊。</details></li><li>It must be hard. If it were me, I would choose to give some. For example, if I have 200,000, I would give at most 100,000. Give it in installments, squeeze out a little whenever they ask for it. I think if you give it all at once, there will be endless bickering later. I suggest not applying the marriage BUFF. There is no happiness after marriage. Firewood, rice, oil, salt, and children will directly explode the family atmosphere and plunge you into an endless abyss. Of course, my suggestion is more of an &#x27;F&#x27;ing&#x27; component. Alas~ It&#x27;s too hard! It must be hard!<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>道友辛苦。 若吾， 则择予部分。 例如有二十万灵石， 吾至多予十万。 宜分期予之， 每次索要，则挤出些许。 以为若一次性予之， 后续必纷争不断。 建议莫点亮婚姻BUFF。 婚后无快乐可言， 柴米油盐加育雏， 家庭气氛骤然爆炸， 必入无尽深渊。 然，吾之建议， 戏言耳。 唉~ 甚苦! 辛苦了！</details></li><li>I directly threw your question to deepseek, and the AI answered very well, so I won&#x27;t post the answer. There&#x27;s a sentence that says it well: Filial piety ≠ unconditional obedience. The real family responsibility is to guide relatives to grow together, not for you to carry the burden alone. Set a &quot;family assistance budget limit&quot; for yourself, and firmly say &quot;no&quot; to anything beyond that.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾径掷汝之问于 Deepseek, AI 回答甚佳，故不复赘述。 有言甚妙: 孝顺 ≠ 无条件服从。 至真之家责，乃引导亲人共求精进，非汝独自负重前行。 为己设定&quot;家助预算上限&quot;， 超出此限，坚拒之。</details></li><li>If your father is only 50 years old and doesn&#x27;t want to work, I think he is a bit lazy. Of course, it may be because he made money early to support three children and got sick. Without knowing the full picture, I won&#x27;t comment. As the second child in the family, you are now the hope of the family. Your parents can&#x27;t count on your older brother, so they count on you. Whether to renovate the house depends on your own strength. Besides your younger sister, there are your parents, you, and your brother. So you need to discuss the specific costs and each person&#x27;s ability to contribute to prevent future disputes. Even with close brothers, accounts should be clear. Also, you said that the house will most likely be given to your older brother in the future. What is your judgment based on? Do your parents favor your older brother? Building a house is not funded entirely by you. You only need to contribute what you should contribute. The rest you need to save for your future life needs. As for wages, it is indeed better to keep them secret from relatives to avoid a lot of unnecessary troubles.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>若汝父年仅五十，便不欲劳作， 恐有怠惰之嫌。 然，或早年营生，以供养三子，致疾缠身。 未知全貌，不予置评。 汝为家中次子， 今乃阖府之冀望。 父母无法倚仗兄长， 故寄望于汝。 翻盖屋舍， 视汝实力而定。 除妹之外， 尚有令尊、 汝， 并兄长， 所须商讨， 明确开支， 各人出资几何， 以免日后争端。 親兄弟明算賬。 且汝云， 屋舍日后大抵予兄长， 汝判所据为何？ 父母偏爱兄长乎？ 营建屋舍， 非由汝全额出资。 汝僅须贡献應出之份。 餘者需积攒， 以备日后生活之需。 至於工薪， 对親族而言， 确宜守口如瓶， 以免诸多不必要之烦。</details></li><li>The poster is not selfish. Your father wants to retire at 50 and doesn&#x27;t think about saving money but wants to spend money to build a house. It can only be said that he is lazy and ignorant. It is right for the poster not to follow their ideas. It is recommended that the poster refuse and say that the money is saved for buying a house for themselves, and the family will not have to spend money when they get married in the future. Ten years later, which is the legal retirement age, they will give their parents money on a monthly basis, and they can do whatever they want at that time. Before that, if they have any requirements, they should ask their brother. Then, all the family property can be given to their brother, and they don&#x27;t want anything.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>楼主非自私。 令尊五十便欲隐退， 竟不思积蓄， 反欲耗资筑室， 可谓怠惰且愚昧也。 楼主不循其意，是也。 荐楼主拒之， 曰资财留作自用， 以购新居， 将来完婚， 亦无需家人操劳。 十年后， 即法定颐养之年， 当按月供奉双亲，屆时任其所为。 在此之前， 若有所求， 皆令兄长应之。 则阖府家产， 亦可悉数予兄， 己身不攫一物， 乃为正道矣。</details></li><li>Having three children and not wanting to work after 50, that&#x27;s really carefree.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>诞育三子， 年逾五十即不愿操劳， 真是潇洒自在。</details></li><li>If the old house in the hometown does have safety hazards, can you consider renovating it instead of building a new one, just like we programmers write code, don&#x27;t just push it over and start over. Your father is still in his prime at 50. Giving up work too early will form a habit of dependency. Moreover, spending all your savings to build a house may require you to provide support again for your brother&#x27;s marriage five years later. For rural self-built houses, you cannot mortgage them when you urgently need money. Even if you really want to give money, it is recommended to reserve at least one year&#x27;s living emergency fund. You can talk to your brother about the financial sharing mechanism (for example, you pay for building materials, and your brother pays for labor). You are not the savior of the family, but the CEO of your own life. Moderate &quot;selfishness&quot; is the survival wisdom of adults, and your current soft-heartedness may become the fuse for future family conflicts. It is recommended to take your father to work in the city for a week to let him truly feel your survival pressure, which is more effective than any persuasion.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>若老家屋舍确潜藏安危， 可否虑修缮而非新建， 犹如吾等程序员撰码， 切莫推倒重构。 令尊五十有五， 尚值鼎盛之年， 过早弃工， 易生依赖之习。 况倾囊筑室， 或五年后， 仍须为君兄婚事再度输血援之。 乡野自建之宅， 急需用资之时， 竟无法抵押贷款。 纵然确欲解囊， 建储至少一稔生计应急金。 可与君兄商议财务分担之法 (如汝出建材之资，兄担人工之费)汝非家族救世主， 乃己身人生CEO。 适度之 &quot;自私&quot; 乃达人之生存智慧， 汝现下心软或将成日后阖府矛盾之导火索。 建请携令尊赴城务工一周， 使其真切感受汝生存之艰， 胜于任何劝谏之言。</details></li><li>Giving money is a matter of course. If you have the ability, give more. If you don&#x27;t have the ability, give less. 200,000 can&#x27;t buy affection, not to mention you won&#x27;t show hand all of it. It is recommended to communicate and explain your actual situation to your family clearly, and be clear about the extent of the help you can provide.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>馈赠资财乃分内之事。 若有余力，则多施； 力有不逮, 则少与之。 二十万灵石难买亲情， 况汝亦不会倾囊相授。 建议沟通为上 ,如实相告汝之家境 , 将可助几何挑明细说。</details></li><li>I haven&#x27;t seen many people&#x27;s parents know the details of their wealth, is it your family knows you have 200,000?

If you&#x27;re willing to take more, you can say it&#x27;s borrowed. In fact, whether it&#x27;s family, acquaintances, or even strangers, it&#x27;s enough to maintain a state of &quot;not much money, but still self-sufficient&quot;.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>鲜有见父母洞悉子女囊中羞涩之辈耳。 莫非令尊已知汝身怀二十万晶石? 缘何视汝为超凡之人?可予卖惨, 言公司相召,商议裁员之事, 今岁寻觅差事甚艰 , 仅能取一两万 , 明年得知汝仍供职于彼, 则云降薪矣。若汝愿多予 , 可婉言借贷而来。 无论亲人、故交或路人, 维系着 &#x27; 囊中余财不多 , 仅可自给自足 &#x27; 之观感便足矣。</details></li><li>It is your brother&#x27;s responsibility to marry a wife.

This is the first time I have seen cases where parents ask their second son for money to help their eldest son get married. However, in such cases, boys usually reject it directly. Boys probably don&#x27;t have any psychological burden to reject such things, while girls may struggle and hesitate for a while. I have a friend like this. However, I have also seen cases where parents give their eldest son more money than their second son. This kind of favoritism is also common in small places, but I have never seen cases where those who have no money ask their second son for money to help their eldest son.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>噫， 见父母向女索资,以助子完婚购居者,已习以为常; 今竟见椿萱向次子求助,以助长子成婚,此实属首次闻也。然此类情形,男子多直言拒绝；于彼辈而言,回拒此事似无甚心理负担，而女子或陷入挣扎犹豫中。鄙人识友， 盖如此。 然亦曾见父母予长子资财,甚于次子者。 甚于小地 ， 偏颇之风亦屡见不鲜者 ， 但未曾遇赤贫者向次子索贿助其长子成室之人。</details></li><li>This is a bottomless pit, run!

If you think &quot;giving&quot; is hard but happy, and it&#x27;s worth it, and family happiness is my happiness, then it&#x27;s worth it.

At that time, my suggestion was that he could give it, and he should be honest about his current situation and his true thoughts. I based it on two points to let the old brother give the money. One is that the siblings had supported each other and helped each other when they were in difficulty before. The other is that the elder sister&#x27;s family is relatively wealthy, and even if the money is gone, there is a high probability that it will be compensated in other forms, so it is considered a human debt. As long as the economy can afford it, there is no problem. However, back to your family, if you open your mouth and say you can give money, no matter how much you give, what will happen in the future? Will your brother be like the elder sister in that post, have a house, a car, and a company, and be able to pay you back in the future? Or do you expect your 50-year-old father to help your brother pay back the money? Or do you expect your younger sister? We like to joke about some girls as supporting brother demons from the perspective of boys, but once you give money, what is the difference in nature from supporting brother demons? You don&#x27;t want to get married now because you haven&#x27;t met the right person, right? What if you meet someone one day, and they don&#x27;t want your money, and you can take out a loan to buy a house and pay back the loan together, then what will you do? You tell your future wife that the money was used to help your brother marry a wife? Now you have two choices, one is to find an excuse to invest in stocks and have no money, so you don&#x27;t give it, and the other is to wait for your whole family to take out a part of the money and then give the money, everyone is fair. Of course, if you still can&#x27;t let go of your face and dignity, you can give more, anyway, it&#x27;s not my money, you know how hard you earn it. Don&#x27;t think that this kind of behavior is selfish. My mother is a counter-example. At the beginning, she relied on my father to go abroad to earn money and spent money on her brothers, sisters, and relatives like sprinkling water. If half of the money that was sprinkled out was given to me, I would have closed my eyes and picked up the Xiaomi SU7 long ago, instead of looking at the BAIC Arcfox Alpha S5, a niche car, with anxiety.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>彼时有所帖子，有姊托弟以投资之名目借贷，当时老朽建议可予之，应坦诚自身境况与心中真真切切所思所虑。老朽以此为根基，使老弟予财。一为昔年幼时，有难时手足相济，你来我往，相互扶持 。 二为老姐家境优渥，即使钱财化为乌有，大概率以它式弥补回来，可谓为人情债。只消经济尚能负担，便无甚可虑。 然，回望汝之家世光景，若开唇吐玉，允诺予财便可，无论予多少，日后将会如何？ 汝之兄弟会否如彼贴中老姐，拥华屋，驾名车，创公司，且日后亦可给予回报？ 难道汝冀望五十之椿萱父母助其兄偿金？还是要指望幼妹？ 吾辈男生喜以此调侃部分女流乃扶弟魔，若汝交付金银，其性质与扶弟魔又有何二致？ 汝不愿成婚礼是因未遇真真切切之人否？ 万一相逢彼辈，无求金玉，可抵押购室，分期共奉，届时汝该如何处之？莫非告之后世知己你以钱财助兄求姻缘？ 现汝有二择， 寻一丝由头投于股海，告知无款可赠，其二，静候阖府取财一掷，人尽其力。 倘若汝仍放不下颜面尊严，大可多掷一些， 横竖非老朽之晶玉，汝知之稼穑艰难不宜倾囊资之。 切莫认同举此不义。吾母为鉴。伊始，恃吾父远渡重洋营生，遂如泼水般撒金于彼辈兄弟姐妹及其亲眷。倘 若撒尽金银之半数予吾，吾早与小米 SU7结缘， 既非瞻望北汽极狐阿尔法 S5 此利基车辆如履薄冰。</details></li><li>1-Your father doesn&#x27;t want to work after 50? 2-Can&#x27;t your brother deliver food or deliver express? In this era of such a strong service industry, is there still a shortage of hard work? 3-Never tell them how much money you have!! Otherwise, they can spend it at ease, anyway, there is you as a backup guarantee. Creditors are also willing to lend. The most likely situation is that they will first borrow money and spend it according to your scale, and then suddenly tell you that they owe 250,000... and then cry to you.. You will be very passive at that time. 4-They just have this understanding. Building a house is mainly for face, as for how you think is completely talking to a duck, not on the same channel, don&#x27;t waste your effort. Another purpose of building a house is to consider for your brother, but it&#x27;s just their single-line thinking. Don&#x27;t put your future in it. Otherwise, they will make you unable to fight back, definitely, definitely. Because they think you can earn money. So they won&#x27;t consider you 5-Looks very cruel, but your thinking level is the normal IQ level of v2, they will not consider your future at all. So don&#x27;t waste your effort. Treat it rationally. 6-Just say that you have saved 50,000 yuan, but you are in debt of 200,000 yuan and need to repay the money every month. It&#x27;s not easy.
