            <h3>父母打电话给我要钱了，跟我心里想的不太一样</h3>
        </details>
        <div class="content">
            <p>1. Family financial situation:
I currently have more than 200,000 in my hand.
There are parents, an older brother, and a younger sister in the family, and they are currently living in a dilapidated house.
My parents are older (in their 50s). My dad doesn&#x27;t want to work anymore because he says he&#x27;s too old to do it.
My older brother was born in 1995, is not married, and has no money.
2. Dad&#x27;s request:
Dad wants me to pay for building a house in my hometown.
I don&#x27;t want to pay for building a house. I want to buy a house in the city and am currently saving for a down payment.
I believe that marriage in the future will require a house, a car, and a bride price, all of which I need to bear myself.
My parents cannot provide financial support and may ask me for money in the future.
3. Concerns about building a house in my hometown:
Even if a new house is built, it will most likely be given to my older brother.
If all my savings are spent on building a house in my hometown, my plan to buy a house in the city will be affected.
I am worried that even if the house in my hometown is built, the other party may not be satisfied when I get married in the future, and I may still have to rely on buying a house in the city myself.
4. Source of pressure:
I feel a lot of pressure because I need to independently bear major expenses such as buying a house and getting married. My parents may also ask me for money to live on.
In fact, I don&#x27;t want to get married anymore. I am currently very desperate. Should I build a house in my hometown, or should I follow my own ideas and buy one in the city? I hope experienced people can give me some advice. Am I being selfish? I am so sad, I have to bear so many things. I was also stupid when I just graduated and showed off to my parents that my salary was over 10,000. I hope my mother can be happy, but my father thinks I am super great. In fact, I am just a beast of burden, always worried about being laid off.</p>

                <p>1.家庭经济状况：
我目前手上有 20 多万。
家里有父母、哥哥和妹妹，目前挤在一个破旧的房子里。
父母年龄较大（ 50 多岁），爸爸不想再干活了，因为他说自己年纪大了干不动了。
哥哥是 1995 年出生，尚未结婚，且手里没有钱。
2.爸爸的要求：
爸爸希望我出钱在老家盖房子。
我不想出钱盖房子，我希望在城里买一套房子，目前正攒首付。
我认为未来结婚需要房子、车子和彩礼，这些都需要自己承担。
父母无法提供经济支持，未来可能还会给我要钱。
3.对老家盖房的顾虑：
即使盖了新房，房子大概率也会给哥哥。
如果把积蓄都花在老家盖房上，自己在城里的购房计划就会受到影响。
担心老家的房子即使盖好，未来结婚时对方可能也不会满意，可能还得靠自己在城里买房。
4.压力来源：
感到压力山大，因为自己需要独立承担购房、结婚等重大开销。父母可能还会向我要钱生活。
其实，我也有点不想结婚了，目前很绝望，我是该给老家盖个房子呢，还是按自己想法，自己城里买一套啊。希望过来人能给点意见。我是不是很自私啊，好难过，要承担好多事，也是自己当初刚毕业傻，给爸妈炫耀自己工资过万了，我希望妈妈能开心点，但是爸爸却认为我是超级厉害的人了，其实我也是牛马而已，时刻担心自己被裁员。</p>

This family environment looks like a bottomless pit...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>还是做个坏人，为自己着想吧。这家庭环境咋看都像无底洞。。。</details></li><li>It&#x27;s been hard on you. If it were me, I would choose to give some. For example, if I have 200,000, I would give a maximum of 100,000. Give it in installments, squeezing out a little bit each time. I think if you give it all at once, there will be endless arguments later. I suggest you don&#x27;t get the marriage BUFF. There&#x27;s no happiness after marriage. The family atmosphere will explode directly with firewood, rice, oil, salt, and children, and you&#x27;ll fall into an endless abyss. Of course, my advice is mostly bullshit. Alas~ It&#x27;s too hard! It&#x27;s been hard on you!<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>辛苦了哈。是我的话，我会选择给一些。比如有 20W 的话，我最多给 10W 。给也是分批给，要一点就挤一点，我觉得一次性给完，后续就无限扯皮了。建议别上结婚 BUFF ，婚后没什么快乐可言了，柴米油盐加孩子，家庭气氛直接爆炸，会陷入无尽的深渊。当然我的建议是放 P 成份多一点。哎~太苦了！辛苦了！</details></li><li>I directly threw this question to deepseek, and the AI answered very well. I won&#x27;t post the answer, but there&#x27;s a good saying in it. Filial piety ≠ unconditional obedience. True family responsibility is to guide family members to grow together, not for you to carry the burden alone. Set a &quot;family support budget ceiling&quot; for yourself, and firmly say &quot;no&quot; to anything beyond that.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你这问题我直接甩给 deepseek 了，ai 回答得很好，答案就不贴了，有段话说得很好。孝顺≠无条件服从。真正的家庭责任是引导亲人共同成长，而不是你独自负重前行。给自己设定一个&quot;家庭帮扶预算上限&quot;，超出部分坚决说&quot;不&quot;。</details></li><li>If your father wants to stop working in his 50s, I think he is a bit lazy. Of course, it is also possible that he made money to support three children in his early years and got sick. I don&#x27;t know the full picture, so I won&#x27;t comment. As the second child in the family, you are now the hope of the family. Your parents can&#x27;t count on your brother, so they count on you. Whether you can rebuild the house depends on your own strength. Besides your sister, the rest are your parents, you, and your brother. Then you guys need to discuss the specific costs and each person&#x27;s ability to contribute to prevent future disputes. Even brothers have to settle accounts clearly. Also, you said that the house will most likely be given to your brother in the future. What is your judgment based on? Are your parents partial to your brother? Building a house is not entirely funded by you. You only need to contribute the part that you should contribute, and the rest you need to save for your future needs. As for salary, it is indeed better to keep it secret from relatives to avoid a lot of unnecessary trouble.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>如果父亲 50 多岁就想不干了，我认为是属于偏懒惰的人，当然，也可能早年赚钱养三个孩子，落下了病，不知全貌，不予置评作为家中的老二，你现在是家里的希望，你父母指望不上你哥哥，所以才指望你，翻盖房子就看你自己的实力，除了你妹妹，剩下的就是你父母，你，跟你哥，那么你们几个人，需要商量好，具体的费用，以及每个人的出资能力，防止后面扯皮，亲兄弟，还要明算账呢还有你说的，房子以后大概率是给哥哥的，请问你是基于什么判断的，是你父母偏心哥哥吗盖房子，也不是你全款出资，你只需要拿出你应该出的那一部分就行了，其余的你需要存好，以备你以后的生活需要，至于工资，对于亲属来说，确实保密好一些，能避免很多没必要的麻烦</details></li><li>The poster is not selfish. Your father wants to retire at the age of 50, and he doesn&#x27;t think about saving money but wants to spend money to build a house. It can only be said that he is lazy and ignorant. It is right for the poster not to follow their ideas. It is recommended that the poster refuse and say that the money is saved for buying a house, and the family does not need to spend money on marriage in the future. Ten years later, which is the statutory retirement age, they will give their parents money on a monthly basis, and they can do whatever they want at that time. Before that, if they have any requirements, they should ask the older brother, and then all the family property will be given to the older brother in the future, and they don&#x27;t want anything.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>楼主不自私，你父亲 50 岁就想退休，然后还不想着攒钱还要花钱盖房子，只能说懒惰又愚昧， 楼主不按他们的想法是对的。建议楼主拒绝，说钱留着自己买房子，将来结婚不用家里花钱，十年后也就是法定的退休年龄，这时候自己会按月给父母钱，到时候他们怎么样都随便。再此之前他们有什么要求，都去找哥哥要吧，然后将来家里的财产也可以都给哥哥，自己什么都不要。</details></li><li>Having three kids, and wanting to stop working in your 50s, that&#x27;s really something.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>有三个娃，才 50 多就不想干活了，真想的开</details></li><li>If the old house in your hometown does have safety hazards, can you consider repairing it instead of rebuilding it? Just like us programmers writing code, don&#x27;t tear it down and start over. Your father is still in his prime at 50 years old. Giving up work early will create a habit of dependence. Moreover, if you spend all your savings to build a house, you may need to inject blood again in five years for your brother&#x27;s marriage. If it&#x27;s a self-built house in the countryside, you can&#x27;t mortgage it when you need money urgently. Even if you really want to give money, it is recommended to reserve at least one year of emergency living expenses. You can talk to your brother about the financial sharing mechanism (for example, you pay for building materials, and your brother pays for labor). You are not the savior of the family, but the CEO of your own life. Moderate &quot;selfishness&quot; is the survival wisdom of adults. Your current softheartedness may become the fuse for future family conflicts. It is recommended that you take your father to work in the city for a week to let him truly feel your survival pressure. This is more effective than any persuasion.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>如果老家房子确有安全隐患，是否可以考虑修缮而非新建，跟咱程序员写代码一样，不要上来就推倒重来你父亲 50 多岁尚处壮年，过早放弃劳动会形成依赖惯性。而且耗尽积蓄盖房，五年后可能需要为哥哥婚事再次输血。农村自建房的话，在你急用钱的时候，无法抵押贷款就算真的要给钱，建议预留至少一年的生活应急金。可以和你哥聊一聊财务分担机制（例如你出建材费，哥哥出人工）你不是家族的救世主，而是自己人生的 CEO 。适度的&quot;自私&quot;是成年人的生存智慧，你现在的心软可能成为未来家庭矛盾的导火索。建议带你父亲到城市务工一周，让他真实感受你的生存压力，这比任何劝说都有效</details></li><li>Giving money is a matter of course. If you have the ability, give more, and if you don&#x27;t have the ability, give less. 200,000 can&#x27;t buy family affection, and besides, you won&#x27;t show hand all of it. It is recommended to communicate and explain your actual situation to your family, and clarify the extent to which you can help.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>给钱是天经地义的事。有能力就多给，没能力就少给点。20 万买不来亲情，何况你也不会全部 show hand 给出去。建议还是沟通，把自己的实际情况与家人讲清楚，能帮助的程度也挑明了。</details></li><li>I haven&#x27;t seen many people whose parents know their financial details. Isn&#x27;t it that your family knows you have 200,000? Why do they think you are super great? Just play the pity card, say that the company asked you to talk about layoffs, it is difficult to find a job this year, you can only take out 10,000 or 20,000. Next year, if they know you are still working at that company, say that your salary has been cut. If you are willing to give more, you can also say it is borrowed. In fact, whether it is family, friends, or even strangers, it is enough to maintain a state of &quot;not much money, but able to support oneself&quot;.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我也没见多少人的父母会知道身家底细的，不会是你家知道你有 20w 吧为啥会认为你超级厉害啊？卖惨呗，说公司找你谈话要裁员，今年很难找工作，只能拿出一两万明年知道你还在那公司做就说降薪了你愿意拿多点也可以说是借的其实无论是家人还是熟人，甚至陌生人，维持一种“钱不多，但还能自给自足”的状态示人就够了</details></li><li>It is your brother&#x27;s responsibility to marry a wife. Parents can help at most. You are an outsider in the middle. You can help or not help, there is no need to feel guilty.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你哥娶媳妇是他自己的责任，父母充其量可以帮衬一下。你在中间就是个外人，可以帮忙，也可以不帮，没必要过意不去</details></li><li>It is recommended not to reveal too much to family members. When relatives and friends ask where you work and how much you get paid, I usually say that I have enough for myself and that I work in a factory.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>建议还是不要透露太多东西给家里人,    亲戚朋友问道哪里工作,   薪水咋样,  我一般都会说自己够用,  进厂打工</details></li><li>Wow, I&#x27;ve seen cases where parents ask their daughter for money to buy a house for their son&#x27;s marriage, and cases where they ask their second son for money for their eldest son&#x27;s marriage. This is the first time I&#x27;ve seen this. But in general, boys would directly refuse this situation, right? Boys probably don&#x27;t have any psychological burden in refusing this, while girls may be painfully conflicted for a while. I have a friend who is like this. However, I have also seen cases where parents give more money to their eldest son than to their second son. This kind of favoritism is very common in small places, but I have never seen a case where parents who don&#x27;t have money themselves ask their second son for money to give to their eldest son.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>哇，问自己女儿要钱给儿子结婚买房的我见过问二儿子要钱给大儿子结婚用的，我倒是第一次见不过这种情况一般男生都会直接拒绝吧，拒绝这种事情男生估计没什么心理负担女生可能会痛苦纠结一会，我有个朋友就是这样不过我也见过父母给大儿子的钱比给二儿子多的情况，这种偏心的情况在小地方也很常见却从没见过自己没钱找二儿子要钱来给大儿子的</details></li><li>This is a bottomless pit, run! Self &gt; Children &gt; Spouse &gt; Parents and Others, this is my priority. If you can&#x27;t even live a good life yourself, how can you fill that black hole? However, it also depends on where the OP&#x27;s own values ​​lie. If you think &quot;giving&quot; is difficult but very happy and worthwhile, and the joy of the family is your joy, then it&#x27;s worth it. After all, people only live once, and living is an experience. Choosing what experience is up to you.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>这是无底洞 快跑自己 &gt; 子女 &gt; 配偶 &gt; 父母和其他人我是这个优先级。自己都过不好，谈何填那个黑洞呢？ 不过也看 op 自己的价值观在哪里啦。你觉得“付出”虽然艰辛但是很幸福，很值，家族的快乐就是我的快乐，那就值。毕竟人只活一次，活着就是体验。选择什么体验是自己决定的。</details></li><li>There was a post before, where an older sister asked her younger brother for money in the name of investment. My advice at the time was that it was okay to give, and to be honest about his current situation and his true thoughts. I was based on two points to let that brother give the money. First, the siblings had supported and helped each other in difficult times before. Second, the sister&#x27;s family was relatively wealthy, and even if the money was gone, there was a high probability that it would be compensated in other forms, so it was considered a favor. As long as he could afford it financially, there was no big problem. But, going back to your family, as soon as you open your mouth and say you can give money, no matter how much, what will you do in the future? Will your brother be like the older sister in that post, with a house, a car, and a company, and be able to pay you back in the future? Or are you counting on your 50-year-old father to help your brother pay back the money? Or are you counting on your sister? We men like to joke about some women being sister-supporting demons, but once you give the money, what&#x27;s the difference between that and being a sister-supporting demon? You don&#x27;t want to get married now, isn&#x27;t it because you haven&#x27;t met the right person? What if you meet someone one day who doesn&#x27;t want your money and can take out a loan to buy a house and pay it off together? What are you going to do then? Are you going to tell your future wife that you gave the money to your brother to marry a wife? Now you have two choices: one is to find an excuse to say that you invested in the stock market, and you have no money to give. Two is to wait until everyone in your family takes out a sum of money, and then you give money. Everyone is fair. Of course, if you still can&#x27;t put down your face and dignity, you can give a little more. Anyway, it&#x27;s not my money. You know how hard you worked to earn it. Don&#x27;t think this behavior is selfish. My mom is a counter-example. She relied on my dad making money abroad and spent money on her siblings and relatives like she was sprinkling water. If half of that money that was spent was given to me, I would have already closed my eyes and picked up a Xiaomi SU7, instead of looking at the Arcfox αS like an unpopular car with trepidation.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>之前有个帖子，是亲姐以投资的名义找弟弟借钱，当时我的建议是可以给，并且要坦白自己目前的处境，以及自己真实的想法，我是基于两点，让那个老哥给钱的，一是姐弟俩之前困难的时候都相互扶持帮忙过，二是姐姐的家庭比较富足，哪怕钱没了很大概率会以其他形式弥补，所以算是人情债，经济上只要自己能承受得起，那就没啥大问题。但是，回到你的家庭，你但凡开口说可以给钱，不管给多少，日后怎么办？你的哥哥也会像那个帖子里的亲姐一样，有房有车有公司，可以未来给你还钱吗？还是你指望 50 多岁的老父亲帮你哥还钱？还是指望你的妹妹？我们站在男生的角度喜欢调侃一些女生是扶弟魔，可是你一旦给了钱，性质跟扶弟魔又有什么区别呢？你现在不想结婚，还不是因为没有遇到正确的人吗？万一哪天遇到了，人家也不图你钱，可以贷款买房一起还贷，到时候你怎么办？你跟你未来老婆说把钱给你哥哥娶媳妇用了？现在你就两个选择，一是找个借口投资炒股了，没钱了，不给，二是等你们全家人都拿出一部分钱，然后再出钱，大家公平点，当然，你要是依然放不下面子和尊严，你可以多出点，反正也不是我的钱，你自己赚得辛不辛苦自己知道。也别觉得这种行为自私，我妈就是个反例，当初仗着我爸出国挣钱，给自己的兄弟姐妹还有亲戚花钱就跟撒水一样，那些撒出去的一半的钱，要是给我的话，我现在早就闭眼提小米 SU7 了，而不是抱着忐忑不安的心态去看北汽极狐的阿尔法 S5 这样一个冷门车。</details></li><li>1. Your father doesn&#x27;t want to work anymore in his 50s? 2. Can&#x27;t your brother deliver food or packages? In this era of such a powerful service industry, is there a shortage of diligent work? 3. Never tell them how much money you have saved!! Otherwise, they can spend it with confidence, because you are the guarantee. Creditors are also willing to lend. The most likely scenario is that they will borrow money according to your scale, then suddenly tell you that they owe 250,000... Then they will cry to you... You will be very passive at that time. 4. That&#x27;s their understanding. Building a house is mainly for face. As for how you consider it, it&#x27;s completely talking at cross purposes, not on the same page. Don&#x27;t waste your energy. Another purpose of building a house is to consider it for your brother, but it&#x27;s just their linear thinking. Don&#x27;t put your own future in it. Otherwise, they won&#x27;t give you a chance to fight back, they will, they will. Because they think you can make money. So they won&#x27;t consider you. 5. It sounds cruel, but your level of thinking is the normal IQ level of v2. They won&#x27;t consider your future at all. So don&#x27;t waste your energy. Deal with it rationally. 6. Just say that you have saved 50,000 yuan now, but you are in debt of 200,000 yuan and need to repay it every month. It&#x27;s very difficult. Show the evidence. Never let these [people who don&#x27;t want to work but want to expand consumption] bring [you] huge financial pressure. Once they know your details, you will be very passive. They may not borrow yours, They can borrow to do things first and tell you after two years that there is still a debt of 200,000... It&#x27;s very difficult, very miserable, will you help?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>1-你父亲 50 多就不想干活了？2-你哥不可以送外卖送快递么？服务业这么强大的时代，还缺勤快活？3-千万不能交底告诉他们你存了多少钱！！否则他们就可以放心地敞开花了，反正有你这个兜底保障在。债权人也愿意借。最可能的情况就是他们先按照你的规模借钱支出完毕，然后突然告诉你欠了 25 万。。。然后给你哭。。你到时候非常被动。4-他们就这个认知。盖房子主要是为了脸面，至于你怎么考虑完全鸡同鸭讲，不在一个频道，不要白费力气。盖房子另一个目的是为了给你哥考虑，但是也仅仅是他们的单线思维。你千万别把你自己的前途搭进去。否则他们会让你没有还手之力，一定会的，一定会的。因为他们认为你能挣到钱。所以他们不会替你考虑的5-看起来很残忍，但是你的思考水准是 v2 的正常智商水准，他们完全不会考虑你的前途的。所以你也别白费力气了。理性对待。6-你就说你现在的确攒了 5 万元，但是在负债了 20 万，每个月需要还钱。很不容易。拿出证据。千万不要让这些 [不想干活又想扩张消费的人] 给 [你] 带来财务上的巨大压力，他们一旦知道你的底细，你会非常被动，可以不借你的但是可以他们先借贷办事两年后告诉你还有 20 万的债务在。。。很难，很惨，你帮不？</details></li><li>@huyi23 It is a matter of course to help, how much to help depends on your own situation.
