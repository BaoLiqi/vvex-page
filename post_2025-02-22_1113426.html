            <p>Seeing many people with average education and over 40 years old, demanding salaries of around 30K~50K~80K+ per month.
1. Where do they get the confidence to demand such high salaries? Or do they think they are worth that much and won&#x27;t work for less?
2. Or are they demanding this much because their previous company paid them so much?
3. Did the platform make you, or are you worth this number?

Can&#x27;t do 8K or 15K? Then why are you looking for a job?

Average education, old age, and no achievements or promotions.</p>

                <p>看到很多学历一般 年龄超过了 40 ，薪资都大约要求 30K~50K~80K 月薪之外，
1. 哪里给的他们地气要求这么高那？还是自己认为我就值这个价格，低于这个的我不做，
2. 还是之前公司给的这么高，就要这么高那？
3. 到底的平台成就了你，还是自己就值这个数字那？

8K ，15K 不能干？那找工作干嘛那？

学历一般，年龄大了，也没有做出什么业绩或者晋升</p>

                <li>Don&#x27;t worry, you will live to be 40 years old too. If you don&#x27;t, then never mind.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>别着急，你也会活到 40 岁那天的，如果活不到，那当我没说</details></li><li>These words, without the beginning and end, actually apply to you now. Please take the initiative to reduce your salary.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>这些话去掉头尾,其实也适合现在的你,请你主动降薪吧.</details></li><li>If you&#x27;ve hired people and are not HR, you&#x27;ll know how stupid it is to be obsessed with education. It is foolish to judge people from a single dimension. Work ability is also multi-dimensional. A team needs people with outstanding individual skills. I wasn&#x27;t interested in replying, but seeing you so diligently promoting your funny and stupid obsession with education on the forum on a Saturday, and even running to someone else&#x27;s post who is sincerely looking for a job to promote it, I couldn&#x27;t help but say, don&#x27;t pat yourself on the back, saying you&#x27;d be willing to work for 8k when you&#x27;re 40. How old are you now, what&#x27;s your monthly salary? Why do you think you&#x27;ll be worth 8k when you&#x27;re 40? On the weekend, do you have no hobbies, no life, or are you stuck working overtime on Saturday, so you come here to slack off? If you have so much free time, why not improve your own understanding?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>如果你招过人，且不是 HR ，就知道唯学历论有多么愚蠢。任何从单一维度来评判人都是愚蠢的。工作能力也是多维度的，一个团队需要各种单项能力突出的人。 本来是没兴趣跟帖回复的，但是见你大周六的在摸鱼论坛如此勤奋地宣扬你那搞笑且愚蠢的唯学历论，还跑去别人一个诚心找工作的帖子下宣扬，忍不住了你也别自己给自己贴金，还 40 岁的时候 8k 都肯干。你现在几岁，月薪怎样？你 40 岁的时候凭什么觉得自己值 8k ？大周末的，是没兴趣爱好、没生活，还是周六不得不加班跑所以来这里摸鱼？这么没事干，不如好好提升下自己的认知吧</details></li><li>OP, your writing level is comparable to Arnold&#x27;s. Random use of paragraph formatting, random use of punctuation, random omission of subjects, and also this inexplicable expression of &quot;30K~50K~80K+ monthly salary&quot;.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>楼主你这文字水平和阿诺有的一拼，乱用格式段落，乱用标点符号，乱省略主语，还有“30K~50K~80K 月薪之外”这种莫名其妙的表达方式。</details></li><li>In fact, older workers asking for 10K salary can&#x27;t even pass the resume screening.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>事实上，大龄打工人要 1W 薪资，简历更过不了。</details></li><li>This lackey reminds me of Lu Xun again: &quot;Mutual harm among the lower classes is the nature of slaves.&quot; Slaves will laugh at you for not kneeling in the standard posture.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>这狗奴才又让我想起来鲁迅：   底层互害，是奴才的本性 。  奴才跪着还会嘲笑你没有他跪的姿势标准</details></li><li>No nonsense, OP I f*** your mother.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>不说废话，楼主我🌞泥🐎</details></li><li>Average education, old age, are they eating your rice? Why so much malice? If you are hiring, evaluate whether the candidate&#x27;s ability meets the requirements of the position, and whether the salary level you can provide is satisfactory to the other party. Where do all these OS come from? If you think the other party is not capable enough and is asking for too much, just politely refuse them. It&#x27;s all market behavior, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>学历一般，年龄大了，吃你家大米了？为啥带那么大恶意。你要是招人，评估候选者能力是否满足岗位要求，自己能提供的薪资水平对方是否满意即可，哪来那么多 OS 。你认为对方能力不足，还狮子大开口，婉拒就可以，都是市场行为，无可厚非。</details></li><li>The environment in China is really bad. In the US, a 40-year-old engineer is at the peak of their earning power. For example, my Tech Lead, conservatively estimated, makes $300,000 a year.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>国内这环境真差，美帝一个 40 岁的工程师正是嘴挣钱的时候，比如我的 Tech Lead ，保守估计 30 万美金一年是有的</details></li><li>I don&#x27;t understand the logic at all, it feels like you&#x27;re just here to scam copper coins. If you think their ability is not worth the corresponding salary, then choose talented young people. If it&#x27;s because you can&#x27;t afford the corresponding salary, hire people who fit the price range. Unless you can only judge the job seeker&#x27;s ability based on their work experience, and the job pricing you offer is not competitive, it seems that posting and exposing your incompetence doesn&#x27;t solve the problem, after all, older workers have no shortage of experience being PUA&#x27;d.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>完全不懂逻辑在哪里，感觉就是来骗铜币的。如果因为能力觉得不值对应薪资，那选有能力的年轻人就行了。如果是因为给不出对应薪资，招符合价位的人即可 。除非是只能通过工作年限来判断求职者能力，然后给出的岗位定价又没有市场竞争力，除了发帖暴露自己的无能之外貌似也解决不了问题啊，毕竟大龄打工人最不缺的的就是被 PUA 的经历了。</details></li><li>The lower-class cattle and horses take advantage of the dividends of the times, gain power for a while, and stand on the so-called commanding heights, but don&#x27;t forget, if you don&#x27;t break away from your own class, the boomerang will always hit you one day.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>底层牛马乘着时代红利，一朝得势，站在所谓制高点颐指气使，但是也别忘了，如果没有脱离自己所在的阶级，回旋镖总有打到自己的一天。</details></li><li>Ability and work attitude have little to do with age. If you have the ability and attitude at forty, it is understandable to ask for so much (whether there are so many senior positions is another question). Of course, how much you ask for also has to do with the market environment. Given the downturn in the internet industry, there are more people than positions, and it will be difficult to find a job if you don&#x27;t lower your expectations. But if someone is currently making 30-80K, they are definitely not a junior engineer anymore, and it is unlikely that they&#x27;ll drop directly to 8-15K to do a junior job. The market is not that bad. I feel that LZ&#x27;s company may not have much money, and they think that they can cheaply get high-performance senior engineers now that the economy is down. But everyone would rather lie at home than do hard work as cattle and horses. This should be the biggest conflict LZ&#x27;s company is facing.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>能力、工作态度跟年龄关系不大。到了四十能力、态度都可以的话，要这么多无可厚非（是否有这么多资深的坑是另外一个问题了）。要多少当然也跟市场环境有关系，在互联网不景气的前提下，人多坑少，如果不降低预期缺失是不太好找的。 但是人家现在 30~80K ，能力肯定不再是初级工程师了，直接降低到 8K~15K 去做个初级工作也不太可能吧。市场也没不景气到这种地步。感觉 LZ 公司可能是没啥钱，觉得现在不景气能便宜捞到高性价比的大龄工程师。 可是大家现在宁愿在家躺着也不想去做苦工牛马。 这个应该是 LZ 公司所遇到的最大矛盾。</details></li><li>If you replaced the programmers with 40+ single older women, I feel like no one would criticize you, it would immediately reverse, mainly because v friends will really be 40+, but most v friends are not female.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>把程序员换成 40+大龄剩女，我感觉就没人怼你了，立刻逆转，主要因为 v 友真的会到 40+, 但是大部分 v 友不是女生</details></li><li>This OP is a bit stupid. First, it implies age discrimination; (The subtext is that 35-year-olds should retire, and those who are still working at 40, even if they are sweeping toilets, should be grateful and picky, and ask for high wages?) Second, ability discrimination without actual basis; (It is everyone&#x27;s right to name their price. If you want to know why they are asking for this price, you should humbly ask for their reasoning, instead of just babbling) Third, discrimination against the person themselves; (What is a platform? Without people, a platform is nothing. Even if the country is great, isn&#x27;t it supported by taxpayers? Babbling, your mind is not right, the upper beam is crooked.)<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>这个楼主有点傻逼。第一，隐含了年龄歧视；（潜台词就是 35 岁都该退休了，40 岁还有工作，哪怕扫厕所，都应该感恩戴德了，还挑三拣四，还要求高工资？）第二，没有实际根据的能力歧视；（别人开多少价都是别人的权利，你想知道别人为什么喊这个价，你就虚心请教，让别人论证，而不是由你叽叽歪歪）第三，对人本身的歧视；（平台是啥东西？没有人的东西算个 P 平台？国家再牛逼，不也是纳税人供出来的？叽叽歪歪，脑袋不正，下梁歪。）</details></li><li>Can&#x27;t afford to hire people, rage quit.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>招不起人破防了</details></li><li>Typical Chinese thinking, pure utilitarianism, Darwinian thinking, actually a typical backward person. From a large perspective, the previous version of utilitarianism and Darwinian thinking ultimately led to fascism, and finally the world war. From a small perspective, we treat the elderly kindly and sympathize with the weak because we may all become weak in some area. Don&#x27;t you ever have bad days or might need to get out of utilitarianism?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>typical 国人想法，纯功利主义、达尔文思想，实际上典型的思想落后的人。从大的角度，上个版本的功利主义、达尔文思想最后导致的就是法西斯主义，最后世界大战从小的角度，我们善待老人对弱者同情是因为自己都有可能在某个领域变成弱者，你难道没有啥状态不好的时候么还是可能需要走出功利主义</details></li><li>Hope OP can also have a 15k salary when they are 40 years old, and be very happy.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>希望 op 到了 40 岁， 也可以拿着 15k 的工资， 爽歪歪</details></li><li>@ily433664 If you can&#x27;t find 8K, it can only be lower, 6K. If the country allows deflation to 800, then you have to do it. It seems that society cannot tolerate wage cuts or economic deflation.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@ily433664 8K 找不到只能更低哈 6K ，如果国家允许通缩到 800 ，那也也得干呀，看来社会不能容忍工资降低或者经济通缩哈</details></li><li>Are you a worker? Why betray your class and defend the interests of capitalists? I rarely use exclamation marks, look carefully: you have betrayed your class!!! You have betrayed your class!!! You have betrayed your class!!!<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你是打工人吗? 为什么背叛自己的阶级, 为资本家维护利益? 我很少说话用叹号, 你看好了:你背叛了自己的阶级!!!你背叛了自己的阶级!!!你背叛了自己的阶级!!!</details></li><li>On the contrary, you can only recognize yourself when you are older. When you first graduated, you didn&#x27;t know your value and were willing to be cattle and horses for 8k or 10k.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>正好相反，年纪大了以后才能认清自己。刚毕业的时候不清楚自己的价值给个 8k10k 也愿意当牛马</details></li>
