            <p>Seeing many with average education and over 40 years old, asking for salaries around 30K~50K~80K per month,
1. Where did they get the Qi to demand such high prices? Or do they think they are worth this price, and won&#x27;t do it for less?
2. Or did the previous company pay them so much, so they want that much now?
3. Did the platform make you, or are you worth that number?

Can&#x27;t do 8K, 15K? Then why look for a job?

Average education, old age, and no achievements or promotions.</p>

                <p>观诸多道友，学历平平，年逾不惑，竟索灵石三万至八万之巨。一问其源，何来如此底气，敢开天价？莫非自诩价值连城，不屑于下顾？抑或前东家所赐甚厚，故欲求同等地位？究其根本，乃平台所成，抑或自身真有此能？若要价八千一万五皆不能应，又何必寻觅他处？学历平庸，年岁渐长，功绩未立，升迁无望，徒增烦恼。</p>

                <li>Don&#x27;t worry, you will also live to 40 someday. If you don&#x27;t, then I didn&#x27;t say anything.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>道友莫急，终有及不惑之日。若寿元不济，权当老朽未言。</details></li><li>Take away the beginning and end of these words, and they are actually suitable for you now. Please take a pay cut.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>去其糟粕，此言亦可应于道友自身。请自降灵石，以正视听。</details></li><li>If you have hired people, and are not HR, you will know how stupid it is to only consider education. Any evaluation of people from a single dimension is stupid. Job skills are also multi-dimensional, and a team needs people with outstanding individual abilities. I wasn&#x27;t originally interested in replying, but seeing you diligently proclaiming your ridiculous and stupid emphasis on education on a forum on a Saturday, and even running to someone&#x27;s sincere job seeking post to proclaim it, I couldn&#x27;t help it. Don&#x27;t try to gild yourself, saying you would be willing to work for 8k at 40. How old are you now, what is your monthly salary? Why do you think you are worth 8k when you are 40? On a weekend, do you have no hobbies, no life, or do you have to work overtime on Saturday so you come here to slack off? If you have nothing to do, you should improve your cognition.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>若非人事，曾招贤纳士者当知，唯学历论之愚。以片面之维衡量人才，实乃不智之举。才干博杂，团队需各有所长之士。本无意附和，然见道友于市集之上，逢周六亦孜孜不倦宣扬学历至上之论，更甚者，奔赴求职帖下喋喋不休，实难忍耐。 莫要自诩清高，妄言不惑之年愿领八千灵石。敢问阁下今夕几岁，月俸几何？何以自认四十年华只值八千？休沐之日，无所事事，抑或奉命加班偷闲？ 若无事可做，当勤修己身，提升认知。</details></li><li>The poster&#x27;s writing level is comparable to Arnold&#x27;s, with random use of formatting paragraphs, random use of punctuation marks, random omission of subjects, and a weird expression like &quot;30K~50K~80K outside of monthly salary&quot;.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>楼主文笔堪忧，比之阿诺有过之而无不及，格式段落无章法，标点符号信手拈来，省略主语更是家常便饭。更有“灵石三万至八万有余”之奇谈怪论，令人费解。</details></li><li>In fact, older workers want a 1W salary, and their resumes can&#x27;t even pass.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>实则年长之修，欲求灵石一万，履历亦难过关。</details></li><li>This lackey reminds me of Lu Xun: Mutual harm at the bottom is the instinct of a slave. A slave will laugh at you for not kneeling in the standard posture.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此等奴才之相，令人忆起鲁迅之言：底层互害，乃奴隶之本性。跪者犹嘲立者姿势不正。</details></li><li>Enough nonsense, poster I f*** your mother.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>废话少提，楼主吾日你仙人板板。</details></li><li>Average education, old age, did they eat your rice? Why so much malice? If you are hiring, evaluate whether the candidate&#x27;s ability meets the requirements of the position, and whether the salary you can provide is satisfactory to the other party. There is so much OS. If you think the other party is not capable enough and asks for too much, you can politely decline. These are all market behaviors, which are understandable.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>学历平平，年岁渐长，难道是食君之粟？何来如此恶意？若招贤纳士，当评判其才是否堪用，予之灵石是否合意。若觉其力不能及而漫天要价，婉拒便是，此乃市场之道，无可厚非。</details></li><li>The environment in China is really bad. In the U.S., a 40-year-old engineer is making money, such as my Tech Lead, who makes at least $300,000 a year.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>国内环境堪忧。美利坚之境，年届不惑之工程师正值丰收之际，如吾之技领，岁入至少三十万美金。</details></li><li>I don&#x27;t understand the logic at all. I feel like I&#x27;m here to cheat copper coins. If you feel that the ability is not worth the corresponding salary, then choose young people with ability. If you can&#x27;t give the corresponding salary, recruit people who meet the price. Unless you can only judge the ability of job seekers based on the length of work, and the pricing of the position is not competitive in the market, it seems that there is nothing else to solve the problem other than posting to expose your incompetence. After all, older workers have the most experience being PUAed.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>毫无逻辑可言，莫非楼主意在骗取铜币？若觉其才不配位，择年轻力壮者即可。若囊中羞涩，则招募价位适宜之人。除非只能以工龄论才，且岗位定价毫无市场竞争力，否则发帖自曝其短，实乃下策。毕竟，年长之修，受PUA之经验最为丰富。</details></li><li>The bottom-level cattle riding the wave of the times, gaining power and pointing fingers from the so-called commanding heights, but don&#x27;t forget that if you don&#x27;t break away from your own class, the boomerang will always hit you one day.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>底层牛马，乘时代之风，一朝得势，便趾高气扬，颐指气使。然切莫忘记，若未脱离自身阶级，回旋镖终有反噬之日。</details></li><li>Ability and work attitude have little to do with age. If the ability and attitude are okay at forty, it is understandable to want so much (whether there are so many senior positions is another matter). How much you want also has something to do with the market environment. Under the premise that the Internet is sluggish, there are more people than positions. If you don&#x27;t lower your expectations, it is not easy to find a job. But now people are 30~80K, and their ability is definitely no longer that of a junior engineer. It is impossible to directly reduce it to 8K~15K to do a junior job. The market is not so sluggish. It feels like LZ&#x27;s company may not have much money, and I feel that the current downturn can cheaply get cost-effective older engineers. But now everyone would rather lie at home than work hard. This should be the biggest contradiction LZ&#x27;s company has encountered.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>能力与态度，与年岁关系不大。若年届不惑，能力与态度皆可，欲求高位亦无可厚非（然是否有如此多的资深坑位，另当别论）。要价高低，亦与市场环境息息相关。若逢互联网之凛冬，人多坑少，则不宜抱有过高期望，寻觅不易。然今夕之人，已达三万至八万灵石，其力断非初级工程师可比。若骤降至八千一万五，委身初级之职，恐难以为继。市场亦未萧条至此地步。 似楼主所在之公司，囊中空虚，欲趁萧条之际，低价获取高性价比之资深工程师。 然今之修士，宁愿高卧家中，亦不愿卖力苦修。此乃贵公司所遇之最大矛盾。</details></li><li>If you change the programmer to a 40+ older leftover woman, I feel that no one will attack you, and it will reverse immediately, mainly because v friends will really be 40+, but most v friends are not girls<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>若将程序员换为四十余岁之剩女，恐无人攻讦，舆论顿转。盖因v友终有及不惑之日，然大多非女修。</details></li><li>This poster is a bit stupid. First, it implies age discrimination; (the implication is that you should retire at 35, and if you still have a job at 40, you should be grateful, even if you are sweeping the toilet. You are still picky and demanding high wages?) Second, ability discrimination without actual basis; (it is everyone&#x27;s right to ask for as much as they want. If you want to know why they are asking for this price, you should humbly ask for advice and let them argue, instead of you whining) Third, discrimination against people themselves; (what is a platform? What is a P platform without people? No matter how great a country is., isn&#x27;t it supported by taxpayers? Whining, the brain is not right, and the lower beam is skewed.)<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此楼主略显愚钝。其一，暗含年龄歧视（其言外之意乃三十五便当归隐，四十尚有营生，即便是扫厕亦当感恩戴德，岂敢挑肥拣瘦，妄求高薪？）；其二，毫无依据之能力歧视（要价几何，乃个人之权，若欲知其底气所在，当虚心请教，使其据理力争，而非无端诋毁）；其三，对人之歧视（平台为何物？无人之平台，不过空谈。国之强盛，亦赖百姓供养，何来妄自尊大之理？）</details></li><li>Can&#x27;t afford to hire people, so I broke defense<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>招揽无力，恼羞成怒尔。</details></li><li>typical Chinese thinking, purely utilitarianism and Darwinism, is actually a typical backward person in thinking. From a macro perspective, the utilitarianism and Darwinism of the previous version ultimately led to fascism and, ultimately, World War II. From a small perspective, we treat the elderly well and sympathize with the weak because we may become weak in some field. Do you have times when you are not in good shape or may need to get out of utilitarianism.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>典型国人思想，纯粹功利主义与达尔文主义，实乃思想落后之辈。宏观而言，此番思想终将导向法西斯主义，甚或引发世界大战。微观而言，我等善待老者，怜悯弱者，乃因彼时彼刻，你我亦有可能沦为此境。 难道道友从未遭遇困境，无需摆脱功利主义之束缚？</details></li><li>I hope OP can also take a 15k salary when he is 40 years old and be very happy<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>愿楼主不惑之年，亦能领灵石一万五，怡然自乐。</details></li><li>@ily433664 8K can&#x27;t be found, only lower 6K, if the country allows deflation to 800, then I have to do it, it seems that society cannot tolerate wage cuts or economic deflation<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@ily433664 若八千难寻，恐只能降至六千。若国允通缩至八百，亦当勉力为之。 看来世人难容降薪或通货紧缩。</details></li><li>Are you a worker? Why betray your class and maintain the interests of capitalists? I rarely use exclamation marks. Look carefully: you betrayed your class!!! You betrayed your class!!! You betrayed your class!!!<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>道友可为打工人？何故背叛自身阶级，维护资本家之利益？吾甚少用叹号，请君明察：汝已背叛汝之阶级！！！汝已背叛汝之阶级！！！汝已背叛汝之阶级！！！</details></li><li>On the contrary, you can recognize yourself after you are older. When I first graduated, I didn&#x27;t know my value and was willing to be a beast for 8k10k<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>恰恰相反，年岁渐长方能认清自我。初出茅庐之时，不知自身价值，愿为八千一万灵石之奴。</details></li>
