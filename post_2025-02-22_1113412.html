            <p>After the New Year, I discovered that Nanjing Mobile has NAT4 throughout the city, which prevents me from running PT, and UDP packet loss is terrible, making remote desktop almost unusable.

I plan to cancel the broadband and switch to China Unicom, but the business hall said that there are still six months left in my four-year contract, and I will be charged a penalty of more than one hundred yuan if I want to cancel the broadband.

I plan not to cancel the Mobile account for now and directly apply for China Unicom broadband. I will use this Mobile broadband to run a PCDN to offset the remaining months of broadband fees until the contract expires (I will upload like crazy, and Mobile may beg me to cancel the account at that time).

The current setup at home is optical modem bridging - soft router dialing - switch connected to various devices below. I want to move directly to the China Unicom optical modem and no longer connect to the Mobile optical modem (there are not enough interfaces to connect to anyway).

Now I feel that a better solution is to connect a separate device to the Mobile optical modem, but now I don't know how to minimize the cost. Should I use a broken second-hand mobile phone or a flashable TV box? Is it feasible to use Qualcomm 410 electronic waste portable WiFi?</p>
            <p>过完年发现南京移动全城 NAT4 ，导致我挂不了 PT ，UDP 还丢包成🐶了，以至于远程桌面也进入几乎不可用的状态

打算销掉宽带换联通，但营业厅说我四年的合约还剩半年，要收我一百多的违约金不然不给拆机销户

打算移动这边先不销户，直接办联通宽带，移动这条宽带就下挂个 PCDN 给自己把剩下几个月的宽带费给平了直到合约到期（疯狂上传到时候移动求着我销户也行）

现在家里是光猫桥接-软路由拨号-交换机再接下面各种设备，想直接挪到联通的光猫下面用，不再接入移动的光猫（也没足够的接口接了）

现在感觉比较好的方案是单独挂个设备在移动的光猫下面，但现在不知道怎么样成本最低，整个破烂二手手机还是整个能刷机的电视盒子？那种高通 410 的电子垃圾随身 wifi 有可操作性吗？</p>
