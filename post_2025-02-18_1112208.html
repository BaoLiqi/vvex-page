                <li>That&#x27;s good. When I first graduated, I worked at my first company for 4 years and only realized my salary doubled when I left (but it was far below market value for staying there for four years, what a loss). You&#x27;ve been keeping up with market trends, so you won&#x27;t lose out.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>挺好的，我刚毕业的时候在第一家公司干了 4 年，出来才发现工资翻倍了(远低于市场价在那呆四年，亏麻了)。 你这一直都紧跟市场行情走，亏不了一点</details></li><li>I&#x27;ve noticed that many people in the comments are still using their experiences from the past few years and continuing to extrapolate linearly, which is a dangerous idea.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我发现评论区很多人还在拿过往几年的经验，继续在做线性外推，这个想法很危险。</details></li><li>It&#x27;s normal. I changed four companies in the five years after graduation. If you feel that not being able to settle down at work is an unhealthy state, then I have a very simple way to cure you. Empty your savings now and put a 15% down payment on a house, and you&#x27;ll be cured immediately.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>挺正常的，我毕业之后五年换了四家公司。你要觉得沉不下心来上班是个不健康的状态，那我有个很简单的方法帮你治好。你现在去掏空存款，首付 15%买套房，马上就治好了。</details></li><li>Change to a company that doesn&#x27;t pay for the five insurances and one fund.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>换不交五险一金的公司</details></li><li>I stayed in a large factory for 8 years after graduation, and I&#x27;ve been in a small company until now. I feel like giving up and just lying flat.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我毕业后在一家大厂呆了 8 年，在一家小公司呆到现在，好像放弃，直接躺平</details></li><li>Summary: Your salary must have increased a lot. Programmers rely on job hopping to increase their salaries.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>总结：工资肯定也涨的一塌糊涂。程序员就靠着跳槽涨工资呢</details></li><li>&#x27;How to Find What You Want to Do&#x27; is a small book by Hitohei Yagi, it&#x27;s very thin and might be useful for you.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>《如何找到想做的事》八木仁平的一本小书，很薄，可能对你有用吧。</details></li><li>I also graduated in &#x27;23, but I haven&#x27;t jumped since I turned into a full-time employee after my senior year internship. I&#x27;ve been in the same company and haven&#x27;t received a raise, I don&#x27;t have the courage to switch jobs.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我也是 23 年毕业的，但是我大四实习转正到现在没跳过，一直在同一家公司，也没涨过薪，没跳槽的勇气。</details></li><li>Summary: Young<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>总结：年轻</details></li><li>Summary: No pressure<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>总结：毫无压力</details></li><li>Switch to remote or freelance work<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>换远程或者自由职业</details></li><li>I suggest you reflect on yourself. I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s no problem with the companies you&#x27;ve been with, but such frequent job hopping means there&#x27;s definitely a problem with your mentality, and this mentality is definitely not good for your development.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>建议反思一下自己，我不是说你待的公司没问题。但是这样频繁跳槽，你的心态肯定是有问题的，这种心态对你的发展肯定不好。</details></li><li>@ymz Then I recommend Zhengzhou or Changsha<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@ymz 那我推荐郑州或者长沙</details></li><li>@jeepc The companies are all good<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@jeepc 公司都不错</details></li><li>Why don&#x27;t you check if you have ADHD? It feels a bit like it. Generally, ADHDers don&#x27;t stay in one job for more than 6 months.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>要不查查是不是 ADHD ？感觉有点符合，一般 ADHDer 一份工作都不超 6 个月</details></li><li>@yvyvyv &quot;Keeping up with market trends&quot;<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@yvyvyv 「紧跟市场行情」</details></li><li>I&#x27;m worse than you. I changed three companies in half a year after graduation, with three housing fund accounts, and in three different provinces.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我比你惨，毕业工作半年，换了三家公司，三个公积金账户，还在三个不同省份</details></li><li>Each time the salary increases, so it makes sense to jump.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>每次工资都在涨 跳也就跳了</details></li><li>@ajaxgoldfish #9 Adjust your mentality, don&#x27;t put too much pressure on yourself, and start little by little.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@ajaxgoldfish #9 心态调整好，不要给自己太多压力，一点点做起</details></li><li>I was just like you when I first graduated, but then I became honest when I had to pay my mortgage.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>跟我刚毕业有一拼 后来要还房贷就老实了</details></li>
