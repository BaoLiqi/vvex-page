            <p>I am 31 years old this year, with no loans, in Shanghai, with a license plate, 40 deposits, and a family of three can save about 18 a year. Parents can subsidize 20% of the car purchase, only considering fuel vehicles. Any recommendations?</p>

                <li>I have driven many European cars (German, Italian, British), and I feel that if I change cars again, I will buy a Toyota/Lexus because it is really easy. My European cars need to be replaced with a lot of things around 60,000 kilometers, including spark plugs, engine oil, brake fluid, gearbox oil, front and rear differential oil, antifreeze, etc., and these accessories are very expensive. My current car costs tens of thousands of yuan for a set. Among them, the engine oil alone costs more than 5,000 yuan, using Shell 10-60 customized engine oil. 6 spark plugs also cost more than 5,000 yuan. These must be replaced, otherwise there will be various minor problems, such as water leakage and oil leakage (bmw is no exception). So it&#x27;s really troublesome. I will choose a Toyota Camry&#x27;s naturally aspirated engine if I buy a car again. I don&#x27;t even need a hybrid. The more electronic configurations, the more failures and the more difficult it is to manage later.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>尝遍欧陆诸车，德意志工巧，意国风华，英伦典雅，然若重择灵驹，当属丰田雷克萨斯，盖因省心也。吾之欧系座驾，行至六万余里，需更换之物繁多，如火花塞、机油、刹车油、波箱油、前后差速器油、防冻液等，且配件昂贵。吾现有座驾，一套下来，耗灵石数万。仅机油一项，便需五千余，用壳牌十至六十之定制机油。火花塞六枚，亦耗灵石逾五千。此皆必换之物，否则小疾不断，漏水漏油等（宝马亦不能免）。甚为繁琐。故再购灵驹，当选丰田凯美瑞之自吸发动机，混动亦不必需，电子配置愈多，则故障愈频，后期愈难打理。</details></li><li>If you don&#x27;t say the purpose, then go for a brz.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>若不明用途，则驭 brz 吧。</details></li><li>@miscnote Are your spark plugs worth more than 5,000 made of gold or silver?

Even the inflatable bed mode of L9 is dwarfed. It is comfortable and safe to sleep wherever you drive. You can stay in the scenic spot for a few days, and go to the bath center when you enter the city.
