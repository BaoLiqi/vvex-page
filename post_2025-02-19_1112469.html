                <li>Whether PHP is outdated is hard to say, but the development of the entire PHP community seems to have stagnated in my opinion. In terms of frameworks, Laravel dominates the global market. The entire PHP open source ecosystem can be said to be the Laravel ecosystem rather than the PHP ecosystem. Domestically, Laravel/ThinkPHP/Hyperf/Webman are equally divided. I have tried almost all of them, but Laravel has the best experience. People who choose Laravel rarely choose TP. Hyperf has the second best experience, but Hyperf also has its own problems, such as not being friendly enough to IDEs. Sometimes errors are reported on xxxx.proxy.php, which is not very convenient for debugging. When the PHP community was active in the past, many frameworks sprang up like mushrooms after rain, and many distinctive frameworks gave people a bright impression. However, when I recently revisited those framework repos, they were either archived or almost not maintained. In terms of resident process/coroutine/asynchronous solutions, the division between domestic and foreign countries is relatively obvious. Domestically, swoole/workerman solutions are preferred, while foreign countries prefer reactphp based on fibers. Swoole uses a hook solution, and the entire asynchronous/coroutine experience is relatively smooth. When fibers were proposed, it was highly anticipated, and the entire PHP community hoped to unify and prosper the PHP coroutine/asynchronous IO ecosystem. But after so many years, it seems that things have gone against expectations. As a third-party extension, Swoole&#x27;s library authors don&#x27;t consider adapting it specifically. PHPers can only wait for the official to pay attention to coroutine/asynchronous support again. I don&#x27;t know how long we have to wait this time. PHP itself also has some problems that need to be solved urgently: php-fpm is a big problem. When a company is very small, fpm is indeed effective and solves (hides) many problems, but once the business scale rises to a certain level, it becomes a burden. Every request has to go through the process of initializing the framework again, which brings a lot of unnecessary performance overhead. As a scripting language, PHP is not weak in performance. Fpm is like a shackle, hindering the release of PHP&#x27;s performance, which has become a very important reason for large companies to abandon PHP. Of course, you say that we have reactphp/workerman/swoole resident process solutions, but for the same reason, without official support for the server under cli, small groups fight on their own, and exert their strength in different directions, and can&#x27;t make much waves. Type problem: 1. PHP succeeds with array, and fails with array. There is a reason for this sentence. Associative arrays are too easy to use. No matter what you do, the first thing you think of is to use array to hold it, and as long as there is one person in the group, associative arrays will fly around, which will greatly reduce the readability and maintainability of the project. Therefore, in my project, associative arrays are only allowed to be used inside methods, and an associative array cannot be passed outside the method. If you want to, please convert it into an object. Even so, you can only restrain yourself, and you cannot restrain third-party SDKs or open source libraries, and it is difficult to completely prevent the abuse of associative arrays. 2. Lack of generic support. Of course, weakly typed languages are not so eager for generic support, but the deeper a PHP project is, the more it feels that there should be generics. Of course, phpdoc helps us declare generics to get IDE support, You have to write phpdoc when you write code, which makes the whole development experience very fragmented and the experience is greatly reduced. Other advanced developments use multi-process/thread/coroutine/lock/timer, etc., not to mention the mess, and the peripheral ecosystem does not have an official language server implementation, so developers can only rely on paid plugins/phpstorm to get a good development experience. The complex environment setup makes the cost of getting started with the language high (there seem to be some community solutions, but they can only be used for development, not production-level). PHP planning issues: The views here are relatively subjective. I think the current PHP community lacks an authoritative leader to lead the planning of PHP development, who has the courage and strength to lead PHP out of its current predicament. As far as I know, the PHP Foundation currently has a total of 10 full-time and part-time developers. Swoole also has many developers in the PHP development team. The development power is not weak, but in recent years, PHP&#x27;s updates have not been surprising.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>或云PHP盛极转衰，社区停滞不前。框架林立，Laravel独尊。开源生态，Laravel为纲。 国内ThinkPHP, Hyperf, Webman 亦欲争锋，然 Laravel 体验更胜，Hyperf 次之，惟 IDE 兼容稍逊，报错或指 xxxx.proxy.php，调试维艰。昔日PHP百花齐放，框架迭出，然今多已归档，维护几无。常驻进程/协程/异步方案，海内外各异。国内尚 Swoole/Workerman，海外Prefer reactphp。Swoole 另辟蹊径，异步体验颇佳。Fibers 提案昔日备受瞩目，然多年已逝，事与愿违。 Swoole 身为第三方扩展，亦无暇顾及适配之事。PHPer 唯待官方重拾协程/异步之志，不知何年马月。PHP自身亦有难解之题：php-fpm 桎梏颇深， 初创公司赖其便捷，规模渐长反成负累，每次请求重走初始化，徒增耗损。PHP本非羸弱，fpm实乃枷锁，束缚性能释放，大厂弃之，此其一因。然reactphp/workerman/swoole 常驻进程之术，亦无官方扶持，徒增内耗，难成气候。类型之惑: PHP 成也 array 败也 array, 关联数组用之过度， 降低项目可维护性. 泛型支持 弱类型语言 弱类型语言对泛型的支持并不严苛, 但项目做的越深，越觉得应该要有泛型。 周邊生態上沒有官方的語言伺服器實現使得開發者只能依賴收費插件/phpstorm 才能獲得良好的開發體驗。而今PHP欲振乏力， 需一领袖带领走出困境。</details></li><li>No, as far as the current situation is concerned, PHP is still unparalleled in terms of fast development and fast launch.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>非也，就目前而言，PHP开发之速，上线之捷，无出其右。</details></li><li>Five-year-old PHP code can still run after installing the corresponding version. Five-year-old Vue templates can&#x27;t even install the packages now, let alone run them.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>五年PHP代码，安装对应版本依然可运行。五年Vue模板，包亦难装，何谈运行？</details></li><li>PHP is the best language on earth.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>PHP，天下第一语言也</details></li><li>Not long ago, I tried Laravel Breeze and felt comfortable from the front-end to the back-end to the CLI. Indirectly draw a conclusion: there are definitely a lot of PHP users.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>近日试Laravel Breeze，前后端皆宜。由是推之，用PHP者定不在少数。</details></li><li>The reason why PHP is extinguished is the demise of small and medium-sized startups, which is essentially caused by economic inactivity. The erosion of other languages can be ignored.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>PHP之衰，乃中小创业凋零所致，实乃经济不振。他语蚕食，不足挂齿。</details></li><li>If you ask AI why PHP is immortal, I believe there will be a standard answer, but for me, feelings are immortal, and PHP is immortal. PHP helped me make money, I will support it until I die.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>若问AI为何PHP不死，当有标答。然于我而言，情怀不灭，PHP不灭。PHP助我生财，我亦挺之至死。</details></li><li>Domestically, everyone has been misled by the so-called high concurrency trend, and PHP has not received the respect it deserves.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>国内为高并发之风所惑，PHP未得应有之敬。</details></li><li>Without a doubt, it&#x27;s outdated. PHP started to decline slowly after the rise of mobile internet in 2010. https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2024TIOBE PHP is ranked 14th, IEEE spectrum PHP is 13th, both falling out of the top 10. Outdated is not dead, although PHP has not much increment, but the stock is still very large, the number of recruitment positions is not necessarily less than Go much. Some people say that the economy is not active, there are fewer start-ups, so there is less PHP. I don&#x27;t agree with this view. There are still many Internet-related start-ups in the United States, but their servers are mainly nodejs, and basically no start-ups use PHP. PHP is being eroded by JS/TS. It is said that PHP has high development efficiency and array is flexible. I agree. However, the dynamic type of PHP is not conducive to iteration and maintenance after three months, and it is also not conducive to multiple back-ends to develop together. Comprehensively, the development efficiency of PHP is not higher than other languages, and even Java writes a few less O and the speed of production is not inferior to PHP. I have written more than 100,000 lines of PHP and Java (excluding generated ones), and the degree of familiarity between the two is close, but it still takes less time to get familiar with PHP than with Java, at least you don&#x27;t need to read the memory model documents, and you don&#x27;t need to study generic erasure, contravariant covariance, etc., and you don&#x27;t need to master the principles and parameters of various GCs. There are many stock PHP projects, but the increment is almost non-existent. There are many old PHP developers, but there are almost no new entrants.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>无疑已矣。移动互联网兴起后，PHP渐衰。观乎TIOBE第十四，IEEE第十三，皆出十强之外。衰而不死，存量尚丰，招聘岗位不逊于Go。或云经济不振，创业稀少，故PHP少，吾不以为然。美利坚新创，多用nodejs，罕见PHP身影。PHP正为JS/TS所蚕食。言PHP开发高效，array灵活，吾亦赞同，然PHP动态类型不利于后期迭代维护，亦难多后端协同。总体而言，PHP开发效率不及他语，纵Java少写几O，出活之速亦不逊之。吾PHP与Java各书十万行，熟悉之程度相近，然熟悉PHP较Java更省时间，无须读内存模型文档，亦无须研泛型擦除，逆变协变之类，更毋庸掌握各种GC之理与参数。存量项目颇多，增量者近乎虚无。老程序员甚众，新入坑者寥寥。</details></li><li>There is a topic, and it&#x27;s not outdated yet. It&#x27;s GG when no one discusses it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>话题尚存，未至没落。无人问津，方为末日。</details></li><li>@gechang Most people do not save lock files, so it may not run after N years. Generally, note the node version and lock file to run the project stably.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@gechang 多人不存lock文件，故N年后或不能行。记下node版本与lock文件，方能稳健运行。</details></li><li>Docker is not friendly, it&#x27;s the most fatal.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>docker不睦，实乃致命。</details></li><li>@runlongyao2 &quot;golang benchmarks java&quot; but what does this mean? How can two completely different languages ​​be benchmarked<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@runlongyao2 云golang 对标java,何出此言？二者天壤之别，怎可对标。</details></li><li>@runlongyao2 #30 I have a lock file, but when installing the package, it doesn&#x27;t go according to the lock, it still scans the package.json to see if there are any version updates, and it&#x27;s hard to say which minor version update will not run<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@runlongyao2 吾存lock文件，然装包之时亦不循之，仍扫package.json，察有无更新，小版本之更新亦可致瘫</details></li><li>Judging from Chengdu, most of the PHP positions have turned g. But if you are doing outsourcing now, PHP is still the first choice. After all, there are ready-made frameworks.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>就成都观之，Php岗位已寥寥无几。而今外包业务，PHP或尚可一选。毕竟现成框架尚存。</details></li><li>PHP is gradually withdrawing from the market. New people are not learning. It&#x27;s all old programmers using it. Graduates are all drilling into java go python. After all, there are too few PHP recruitment positions now. The requirements are high. Basically all-stack. Graduates can&#x27;t do it either.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>PHP渐次退出，新人止步。唯老程序者用之。应届生皆趋java go python，毕竟php岗位少，要求甚高，需全栈之人，应届生亦难胜任。</details></li><li>PHP mainly has the value of the original programming mode of mixing code and web templates, but the problem is that the current popular solution is pure server API, and the client can be web js or mobile terminal, which is more convenient for completely isolating the server and client and supporting any Clients Obviously this architecture is more suitable. For example, there was only a website at the beginning, but later it may become bigger and develop apps or even desktop software. At this time, the advantage of the server-side pure API becomes apparent.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>以PHP混编代码为贵，然今服务器独走API，客端Web JS或移动端皆可，彻底隔离服务与客，任凭客户端调度。若起始网站起家，其后做大，APP乃至桌面程序或可期，服务化API架构优势尽显</details></li><li>php=porn, how can it be outdated?

Are you staying in php5?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@iorilu 一观汝言便知未曾操刀。</details></li><li>@gechang Node this set, let alone 5 years ago, will not run after a while, it is really difficult.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@gechang Node此套，莫说五年前，不久便罢，甚难受。</details></li>
