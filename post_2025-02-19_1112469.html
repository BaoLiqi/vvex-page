                <li>It&#x27;s hard to say whether PHP is outdated, but in my opinion, the development of the entire PHP community does have a stagnation trend. At the framework level, Laravel dominates the global market. The entire PHP open source ecosystem is more like the Laravel ecosystem than the PHP ecosystem. Domestically, Laravel/ThinkPHP/Hyperf/Webman are evenly matched. I have tried almost all of them, but the best experience is still Laravel. People who choose Laravel rarely choose TP anymore. Hyperf is second best in terms of experience, but Hyperf also has its own problems, such as being not friendly enough to IDEs. Sometimes errors are reported on xxxx.proxy.php, which is not convenient for debugging. When the PHP circle was active in the past, many frameworks sprung up like mushrooms, and many characteristic frameworks gave people a bright impression. However, when I recently flipped through those frameworks&#x27; repos, they were either archived or barely maintained. In terms of resident processes/coroutines/asynchronous solutions, the domestic and foreign divisions are more obvious. Domestically, Swoole/Workerman schemes are preferred, while foreign countries prefer ReactPHP based on fibers. Swoole takes a different approach by using hook schemes, and the entire asynchronous/coroutine experience is relatively smooth. Back then, the fibers proposal was highly anticipated, and the entire PHP circle hoped to unify and prosper the PHP coroutine/asynchronous IO ecosystem. However, after so many years, it seems that things have not gone as expected. As a third-party extension, Swoole&#x27;s library authors rarely consider adapting it specifically. Phper can only wait for the official to pay attention to coroutine/asynchronous support again. I don’t know how long we have to wait this time. PHP itself also has some problems that need to be solved urgently: php-fpm is a big problem. When a company is very small, fpm is indeed very effective and solves (hides) many problems, but once the business size rises to a certain level, it becomes a burden. Every request has to go through the process of initializing the framework again, which brings many unnecessary performance overheads. As a scripting language, PHP is not weak in performance. Fpm is like a shackle, hindering the release of PHP&#x27;s performance, which is also a very important reason for large companies to abandon PHP. Of course, you say we have reactphp/workerman/swoole resident process solutions, but for the same reason, without official support for servers under cli, each small group fights independently, and no one can make much of a splash. Type problem: 1. PHP succeeds with array and fails with array. There is a reason for this sentence. Associative arrays are too easy to use. No matter what you do, the first thing you think of is to use array to store it. As long as one person in the entire group has associative arrays flying around, it can greatly reduce the readability and maintainability of the project. Therefore, in my project, only associative arrays are allowed to be used within methods. An associative array cannot be passed outside the method. If you want to, please convert it to an object. Even so, you can only restrain yourself and cannot restrain third-party SDKs or open source libraries, and it is difficult to completely prevent the proliferation of associative arrays. 2. Lack of generic support. Of course, weak type languages do not have such an urgent need for generic support, but the deeper a PHP project is, the more you feel that there should be generics. Of course, phpdoc helps us declare generics for IDE support, but writing code and writing phpdoc makes the entire development experience very fragmented and the experience drops a lot. Other advanced development uses multi-process/thread/coroutine/lock/timer and other messy things, not to mention that the surrounding ecosystem does not have an official language server implementation, so developers can only rely on paid plugins/phpstorm to get a good development experience. The complex environment setup makes the language more costly to get started (there seem to be some community solutions, but they can only be used for development and are not production-level). PHP planning issues: The views here are more subjective. I think the PHP circle currently lacks a leader with sufficient authority to lead the planning of PHP development, and has the courage and strength to lead PHP out of its current predicament. As far as I know, the PHP Foundation currently has a total of 10 developers, full-time and part-time. Swoole also has many developers in the PHP development team, and the development strength is not weak, but PHP&#x27;s updates in recent years have not brought surprises.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>php 有没有过气不好讲，但是整个 php 社区发展在我看来确实有停滞的趋势了。框架层面，全球市场 laravel 一家独大，整个 php 开源生态与其说是 php 生态，不如说是 laravel 生态，国内的话 laravel/thinkphp/hyperf/webman 倒是分庭抗礼，我也几乎都试过，但是用下来体验最好的还是 laravel ，选 laravel 的一般很少选 tp 了，hyperf 体验次之，但是 hyperf 也有自己的问题，比如对 IDE 不够友好，有时候报错会报道  xxxx.proxy.php 上，不太方便调试。以前 php 圈子活跃的时候，有很多框架如雨后春笋般冒出来，很多有特色的框架会给人眼前一亮的感觉，然而最近再去翻那些框架的 repo ，要么 archive 了，要么就几乎不维护了。常驻进程/协程/异步方案上，国内外分化地比较明显，国内偏好 swoole/workerman 方案，国外更偏好基于 fibers 的 reactphp ，swoole 另辟蹊径使用 hook 方案，整个异步/协程的体验比较丝滑。当年 fibers 提案时被寄予厚望，整个 php 圈子希望由此统一并繁荣 php 的协程/异步 IO 生态，不过这么多年过去了，看起来事与愿违。而 swoole 作为一个第三方扩展，库作者开发库时，也不太会考虑为其专门做适配。phper 只能等待官方再一次重视协程/异步支持，不知道这一次又要等到猴年马月去了。php 本身也有一些问题亟待解决：php-fpm 是一个很大的问题，当一个公司很小的时候，fpm 确实很奏效，解决（隐藏）了很多问题，但是一旦业务规模上升到一定程度，他就成了累赘，每一个请求都要重新走一遍初始化框架的流程，这带来了很多不必要的性能开销。php 作为一个脚本语言，其实性能并不弱的，fpm 就像一个枷锁，阻碍了 php 的性能释放，这也成为大公司抛弃 php 的一个很重要的原因。当然你说我们有 reactphp/workerman/swoole 常驻进程方案，但同样的道理，没有官方对 cli 下 server 的支持，各个小群体各自为战，劲使不到一处，又能翻多大的水花。类型问题：1. php 成也 array ，败也 array 这句话不是没有缘由的，关联数组太好用了，无论做什么，第一时间想到的就是用 array 来装，而整个组里只要有一个人，关联数组到处乱飞，就能极大地降低项目的可读性和可维护性，所以在我的项目里，只允许方法内使用关联数组，一个关联数组不能传到方法外面，如果要，就请转成对象，即便如此，你也只能约束自己，无法约束第三方的 SDK 或者开源库，很难完全阻止关联数组的泛滥。2. 缺少泛型支持，当然弱类型语言对泛型的支持并不那么迫切，但一个 php 项目做的越深，就越觉得应该要有泛型，当然有 phpdoc 帮助我们声明泛型从而获得 IDE 的支持，但是写代码还要写 phpdoc 让整个开发的体验很割裂，体验下降了一大截。其他的高级开发用到的什么多进程/线程/协程/锁/定时器乱七八糟的就不说了，而且周边生态上没有官方的语言服务器实现使得开发者只能依赖收费插件/phpstorm 才能获得良好的开发体验，环境搭建复杂，使得语言上手的成本较高（似乎是有一些社区方案，不过都只能开发使用，并不是生产级的）。php 规划的问题：此处看法比较主观，我觉得目前 php 圈子缺乏一个有足够权威的大佬领导规划 php 的开发，能有魄力和实力带领 php 走出目前的困境，据我所知 php 基金会目前全职加上兼职总共有 10 名开发者，swoole 也有不少开发者在 php 开发组，开发力量不算弱，但近年来 php 的更新并没有给人带来惊喜。</details></li><li>No, as far as development speed and deployment speed are concerned, PHP is unmatched.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>没，就目前而言 PHP 在开发快，上线快这点上无人能及</details></li><li>PHP code from five years ago can still run if you install the corresponding version.

PHP started to decline slowly after the rise of the mobile internet in 2010. https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2024 TIOBE PHP ranks 14th, IEEE spectrum PHP ranks 13th, both falling out of the top 10. Outdated is not dead, although PHP does not have much increment, the stock is still very large, and the number of recruitment positions may not be much less than Go. Some people say that the economy is inactive and there are fewer startups, so there is less PHP. I don&#x27;t agree with this view. There are still many Internet-related startups in the United States, but their servers are mainly based on nodejs, and you can hardly see startups using PHP. PHP is being eroded by JS/TS. I agree that PHP has high development efficiency and array flexibility. However, PHP&#x27;s dynamic typing is not conducive to iteration and maintenance after three months, nor is it conducive to collaboration between multiple backends. Comprehensively, PHP&#x27;s development efficiency is not higher than other languages, and even Java&#x27;s speed of producing results after writing a few less Os is not inferior to PHP. I have written more than 100,000 lines of PHP and Java (excluding generated ones), and the familiarity between the two is close, but it still takes a lot less time to become familiar with PHP than Java. At least you don&#x27;t need to read the memory model documentation, and you don&#x27;t need to study generic erasure, contravariance, and covariance, let alone master the principles and parameters of various GCs. There are many PHP projects in stock, but there is almost no increment. There are many old PHP developers, but there are almost no new entrants.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>毫无疑问，过气了。2010 年移动互联网兴起后 PHP 就开始衰慢慢退了。https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2024TIOBE PHP 排第 14 ，IEEE spectrum PHP 第 13 ，双双跌出前 10 。过气了不是死了，PHP 虽然没多少增量了，但存量还是很大的，招聘职位数量不一定比 Go 少多少。有人说经济不活跃，创业公司少所以 PHP 少，我不认同这个看法。美国依然有很多互联网相关创业公司，但他们服务端以 nodejs 为主，基本上看不到初创用 PHP 的，PHP 正是被 JS/TS 蚕食了。说 PHP 开发效率高，array 灵活，我赞同。但 PHP 动态类型不利于三个月以后的迭代和维护，也不利于多个后端共同开发。综合的看，PHP 的开发效率没有比其它语言高，甚至 Java 少写几个 O 之后出活速度也不输于 PHP 。我 PHP 和 Java 都写过 10 万行(不含生成的)以上，两者熟悉程度接近，但熟悉 PHP 还是要比 Java 少花很多时间，至少不用读内存模型的文档，也不用研究泛型擦除，逆变协变之类的东西，更不用去掌握各种 GC 的原理和参数。存量 PHP 项目很多，但增量约无。老 PHP 开发不少，但新入坑的约无。</details></li><li>There&#x27;s a topic, so it&#x27;s not outdated yet.

Newcomers don&#x27;t learn it. They are all old programmers using it. Fresh graduates are all digging into java go python because there are too few PHP recruitment positions now.

Fresh graduates can&#x27;t do it either.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>PHP 现在逐步退出市场   新人不学。都是老程序员在用。 应届生都在往 java  go  python 里面钻   毕竟现在 php 招聘的岗位太少。 要求又高。基本要全栈。 应届生也也干不了</details></li><li>PHP mainly has value in the original programming model that mixed code and web templates, but the problem is that the current popular solution is a pure API on the server side, and the client can be web js or mobile, which is more convenient for the server and client to be completely isolated and supports any client. Obviously, this architecture is more suitable. For example, if you start with only a website, but later it may become larger and you will make an app or even desktop software, then the advantage of a pure API on the server side comes out.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>php 主要是原来那种混合代码和网页模板的编程模式还是价值但问题是现在基本流行方案是服务端纯 api, 客户端可以是 web js 或移动端更方便服务端和客户端彻底隔离且支持任意客户端很显然这种架构更合适比如说开始只有网站 , 但后面可能做大了会做 app 甚至桌面软件, 这时候服务端纯 api 的优势就出来了</details></li><li>php=porn, how can it be outdated?
