        <h1>Guys, recommend a router</h1>
        <h2>大佬们推荐个路由器</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I got a 500M Telecom broadband on the weekend. The optical modem is in the living room, two walls and 5m away from my room. The 2.4G wifi can connect, but the internet speed is very poor. It takes a long time to load videos. The 5G wifi cannot connect at all. Now I want to buy a gigabit router. I looked at ZTE's Xuntian BE5100, ZTE's Xuntian BE5100pro+, and ZTE's Xuntian AX3000pro+. I don't know if it is enough to buy ZTE's Xuntian BE5100. The comments say its wall penetration is average.</p>
            <p>周末拉了个 500M 电信宽带，光猫在客厅，离我的房子有两堵墙，5m 远，2.4G 的那个 wifi 可以连上，但是网速贼差，刷视频都要卡半天，5G 那个 wifi 根本连不上
现在想买个千兆路由器，看了一下中兴巡天版 be5100 、中兴巡天版 be5100pro+、中兴巡天版 ax3000pro+。不知道买中兴巡天版 be5100 够不够用，评论说穿墙一般</p>

                <li>Spending money on a router is not as effective as running a network cable, or invisible fiber optic.<br>花钱买路由器的效果不如走一下网线，或者隐形光纤。</li><li>I bought ZTE Xuntian AX3000Pro+, which replaced the old Netgear RAX80; the experience is very good, there is no disconnection or lag, and the whole house 5G is very stable.<br>我买的中兴巡天 AX3000Pro+，替代了老旧的网件 RAX80 ；体验很好，没有断联卡顿的情况，全屋 5G 很稳定。</li><li>@hangzhou #2 Are you renting a room? Then run a flat network cable along the skirting line of the living room all the way to the bedroom. As long as it is pulled into the bedroom, any router will do. In the past, it was actually measured that the network speed of TP routers costing a few hundred yuan was greatly reduced and the delay was huge when passing through two walls (load-bearing walls).<br>@hangzhou #2 你是合租的房子吧？那就沿着客厅踢脚线搞个扁网线，一路顺到卧室内，只要拉到卧室里，随便一个路由都行了。以前实测 TP 几百块钱的路由器穿两堵墙（承重墙）网速降的厉害，延迟巨大。</li><li>@wxw752 I don’t understand this. The person who installed the broadband said to get a router. I’ll check it out.<br>@wxw752 不懂这个 安装宽带的人说搞个路由器 我去查查</li><li>If you don't have high requirements for latency, you can try the mesh routers on the market.<br>如果对延迟的要求不高，可以试试市面上那些 mesh 的路由器</li><li>Wireless is a two-way connection. It's not enough for the AP to have strong transmission power. The AP that the terminal sends back must also be able to receive it. I have never had any requirements for internet speed... 100mbps Telecom broadband is also very easy to use, so if there is a network cable in the room, installing it directly in the room is the right solution. As for whether the equipment is sufficient, of course, what is sufficient varies from person to person. 100mbps of external network is enough for me to play games/watch TV. The equipment is an old tp wdr 4310 flashed with openwrt.<br>无线是双向连接，不是 AP 发射功率强就行，终端发回去的 AP 也能接收到才可以。对网速一向没要求。。。就 100mbps 的电信宽带也很好用，所以如果房间内有网线，直接安装在房间内才是正解。至于设备够用就可以，当然这个够用对于不同人需求都不同，100mbps 的外网就足够我玩游戏/看电视，设备是老掉牙的 tp wdr 4310 刷 openwrt 。</li><li>The effect of a single router with two walls will probably not be very good, so you still need to get two routers and set up a mesh.<br>两堵墙单路由效果估计也不会太好，还是要搞两个路由，组个 mesh</li><li>I bought the ZTE Xuntian be5100pro+. The background management is really rubbish, and I have hardly seen any firmware updates, but the signal is okay.<br>我买了中兴巡天版 be5100pro+这个，后台管理是真垃圾，也基本没见过固件更新，但是信号还可以。</li><li>5 meters away, 5100 is not enough at all. It's best to run a network cable over and then connect a router. If that doesn't work, you can buy two small routers like ax3000 and build a mesh.<br>5 米远，5100 根本不够啊。最好还是拉个网线过去，再接路由。不行的话，可以买两个 ax3000 之类的小路由，组 mesh</li><li>TP's xdr5480, the measured signal is not bad in the newly built house in my hometown, bought on pdd for a little over 300.<br>TP 的 xdr5480 ，在老家新盖的房子实测信号还不错，pdd 300 多点买的</li><li>I think Wi-Fi should not be used through walls if possible. Use the router itself or a wireless router with DHCP turned off to connect to the LAN port to cover frequently used areas; this will better guarantee speed, signal, and mobile device battery life. Specifically in the case of the poster, you can run a network cable from the living room to the room where you use the Internet, and then buy a wireless router that supports Wi-Fi 6 (axXXXX), turn off DHCP in the settings, and then connect the network cable to any LAN port. In this way, the new router can supplement the coverage that the optical modem Wi-Fi does not cover, but unless the price difference is not big in frequently used areas, there is no need to buy a Wi-Fi 7 (beXXXX) router at this stage, and mobile devices have not yet been popularized.<br>我认为 Wi-Fi 有条件还是不要穿墙使用，经常使用的区域用路由器本体或者关掉 DHCP 的无线路由器接 LAN 口来覆盖；这样速度、信号、移动设备续航都有更好的保证具体到楼主的情况，可以从客厅拉一根网线到你上网的房间，再买个支持 wi-fi 6 (axXXXX) 的无线路由器，设置里关掉 DHCP 然后网线接任意 LAN 口。这样的话新路由器可以补充覆盖光猫 Wi-Fi 覆盖不到的，但经常使用的区域除非价格差别不大，现阶段无需买 Wi-Fi 7 (beXXXX) 的路由器，移动设备这边还没有普及</li><li>A single router won't do it. For high-quality internet access, you need to add another router in your bedroom. I use ZTE QingTian + XunTian. Although ZTE has low hardware configuration and cannot be flashed, it is stable.<br>单个路由器搞不定的，要高质量上网，你的卧室要再加个路由器。我是用中兴晴天+巡天，虽然中兴硬件配置低也刷不了机，但是稳。</li><li>The wifi signal of the optical modem is indeed not very good. If there is a pre-embedded network cable, a cheap router can be used. If you don't want to bother, just replace the router.<br>光猫自带的 wifi 信号确实不太好，如果有预埋网线的话，搞个便宜路由器即可。懒得折腾的话直接换个路由器</li><li>I suggest you go to Xianyu to buy an ax3000 that the operator has returned for less than 70 yuan, and then buy a network cable and run it to the room.<br>建议你直接去闲鱼买个 ax3000 那种运营商退下来的也就 70 块钱不到，然后买一根网线拉到房间里。</li><li>If possible, use wired Mesh with a network cable. If you don't pull a network cable, use wireless Mesh.<br>可以的话，拉网线用有线 Mesh不拉网线 就用 无线 Mesh</li><li>@zwy100e72 There are no conditions, I rent a house in Beijing, and I can't decide whether to go through the wall 😂 Is it necessary to buy wifi7? But I read several comments below wifi6 saying that the wall penetration effect is not good.<br>@zwy100e72 没条件呀，在北京租的房子 穿不穿墙由不得我😂 无需购买 wifi7 吗，但是我看了好几个 wifi6 下面的评论说穿墙效果不行</li><li>wifi6 and wifi7 are not suitable for going through walls.<br>wifi6 、wifi7 都不适合穿墙</li><li>Two AX3000 Xuntian group MESH is enough.<br>两个 AX3000 巡天组 MESH,够用了</li><li>@NamelessRain Forgot about Xianyu, thanks for reminding.<br>@NamelessRain 把咸鱼都忘了 多谢提醒</li><li>@zuosiruan I don't have high requirements, I just want to be able to watch Blu-ray movies and not play games.<br>@zuosiruan 我要求不高 电影能看蓝光就行 不打游戏</li>
