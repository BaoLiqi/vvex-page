            <h3>丁克十年的感想</h3>
        </details>
        <div class="content">
            <p>There have been many posts about being childfree recently, but few middle-aged childfree people have come out to express themselves, so I want to clarify some misunderstandings.

My wife and I actually like children, but being childfree was our joint decision. Any choice we make can be said to be selfish. Let me briefly explain why I am childfree:
1. Raising children requires a lot of energy. I put this energy into my hobbies, and the happiness I get is much greater.
2. Raising children in China is very expensive, which affects my ability to live a relaxed life.
3. There is too much unscientific content in schools now, and political bias is increasing. If I were a parent, I would clash with teachers.

Next, let&#x27;s analyze some of the most misunderstood viewpoints:

## Being Childfree is Because You Lack Money; You&#x27;ll Want Children When You&#x27;re Older and Have More Money
If you have this view, it means you didn&#x27;t want to be childfree in the first place.

My family is not short of money now, but most of our energy and expenses are invested in hobbies. The key here is whether you have hobbies to enrich your life, not money. If you often feel bored, you will naturally want to have a child when you see others enjoying the joys of raising children. But think rationally, does raising children, which takes up a lot of fixed time, bring more happiness than hobbies like reading, writing, or painting, which allow for flexible time allocation?

The hobbies I&#x27;m talking about here are not entertainment. Scrolling through short videos, browsing Weibo, traveling, eating delicious food, etc., are entertainment that almost everyone enjoys. Hobbies require effort with the goal of improvement or deeper exploration, allowing people to maintain passion and focus for a long time. Taking running as an example, forcing yourself to run a few kilometers every day to stay healthy doesn&#x27;t count as a hobby; at most, it&#x27;s a good habit. However, if you have a goal for your marathon finish time and create a schedule to stick to training, it&#x27;s a hobby. This goal will have you collecting news and information about running everywhere, taking up a lot of thinking time, and the psychological satisfaction and physical health brought about by a marathon PB go without saying.

## Being Childfree is Equivalent to Giving Up Some Social Relationships
This is closely related to the hobbies mentioned in the previous point. The social circles of most working people are basically colleagues and relatives, two groups of people you can&#x27;t choose, and it&#x27;s difficult to meet people with the same values and who are fun to be around. But it&#x27;s different with hobbies. For example, my wife and I enjoy trail running, hiking, and rock climbing. We can basically meet strangers and exchange contact information at every activity. After becoming friends, they will introduce new friends to expand the circle. If you don&#x27;t want to waste too much time, you have to carefully select a few to communicate with in depth. Most importantly, these friends are the ones I chose, who can understand my pursuits, even share my goals, and work hard alongside me.

Also, with hobbies, you don&#x27;t need too many social relationships at all. I like to be alone most of the time. For example, I&#x27;ve read hundreds of books on WeChat Reading and marked more than two thousand movies on Douban. If I want to discuss books and movies, I prefer to comment on Douban.

## Being Childfree is Bad When You Get Old
Most people actually oppose this view personally because their non-childfree parents also don&#x27;t have a good time when they get old. As children, they need to leave home to work in big cities and only return home occasionally during holidays, and their energy is mainly invested in their own children, making it difficult to take care of the elderly.

Leaving aside whether children will treat you well when you get old, let&#x27;s talk about health and elderly care. Most people invest the 30-50 age range of their lives in raising children, and their physical condition may deteriorate at 65. Many working people around the age of 30 suffer from illnesses such as obesity, high blood pressure, and lumbar disc herniation. I am currently over forty and still have no illnesses, mainly due to a lot of exercise and sufficient sleep. It&#x27;s not to say that more exercise will prevent all diseases, but the probability will be much lower. In addition, my body fat is around 10%, I can do more than 30 pull-ups with a forward grip, and I have a marathon PB of 3:10. I believe that even at 70, I will be in better physical condition than most 30-year-olds. Do I still need to worry about elderly care? Because I mainly do endurance sports and rock climbing, I&#x27;m not heavy, I don&#x27;t have a lot of muscle, and I look young. Many strangers mistake me for being in my twenties. This may also be a major advantage of being childfree.

## Childfree People Shouldn&#x27;t Get Married
People who hold this view don&#x27;t understand what legalizing same-sex marriage abroad is about, and they definitely can&#x27;t understand various equality struggles. Moreover, the legal benefits of marriage bring not only psychological security, but also a guarantee similar to critical illness insurance. No matter how happy you are now, you cannot guarantee that the marriage will be stable forever.

In addition, marriage brings stable relationships, and many papers have confirmed the huge benefits of stable relationships for health, as discussed in various psychology books such as &quot;Intimate Relationships.&quot;

## Men Who Choose to Be Childfree Should Get a Vasectomy
This view itself is black and white, as extreme as &quot;if you don&#x27;t like driving, then you should cancel your driver&#x27;s license.&quot;

First of all, let me explain that I understand that vasectomy will not affect health, and I am willing to get a vasectomy, but I haven&#x27;t had one because my wife won&#x27;t let me. I said before that we like children, and if the government becomes as democratic and rule-of-law-based as in Northern Europe and Iceland, we might have them, but of course I know the probability is lower than winning the lottery.

Childbearing is a matter for two people. As long as they agree, there&#x27;s nothing that can&#x27;t be done.</p>

                <summary>Show Chinese Content</summary>
                <p>最近丁克的贴子特别多，但是很少中年丁克出来表达，所以我想来澄清一下若干误解。

我和老婆其实是喜欢小孩的，但丁克是我们的共同决定。我们不论做什么选择都可以说是自私的，简单说下我为什么丁克：
1. 养孩子需要很多精力，我把这些精力投入到爱好中，获得的幸福感会多得多
2. 生养孩子在中国非常费钱，影响我躺平
3. 现在学校中的教育太多不科学，政治偏向越来越多，我如果成为家长会和老师发生冲突

接下来分析一下大家误解最多的几个观点：

## 丁克是因为缺钱，到中年不缺钱了会想要小孩
如果你有这个观点，说明你一开始就不想丁克。

我家现在不缺钱，但大部分精力和花费都投入了爱好。这里问题的关键是你有没有爱好来充实生活，而不是钱。如果你经常感到无聊，看到别人养孩子的快乐瞬间自然也会想养一个。但理性思考一下，养孩子占用很多固定时间，会比看书、写作、画画之类灵活分配时间的爱好带来更多快乐吗？

这里说的爱好不是娱乐，刷短视频、看微博、旅游、吃美食等等是几乎每个人都喜欢的娱乐，爱好是需要花费精力以提升或者深入为目标的，可以让人长时间保持激情和专注。拿跑步来举例，每天逼着自己跑几公里保持健康，算不上爱好，顶多是个好习惯，但是如果有全马完赛时间目标，并且列出课表坚持训练，就属于爱好。这种目标会让你四处收集跑步相关的新闻和资料，占用很多思考时间，而全马 PB 带来的心理满足感和身体健康就不用多说了。

## 丁克相当于放弃一部分社会关系
这和上一条所说的爱好关系密切。大部分打工人的社交基本就是同事和亲戚，两部分人都是你无法选择的，很难遇到三观一致和玩得开心的人。而有了爱好就不同，比如我和老婆玩越野跑、徒步、攀岩，基本每次活动都能认识陌生人交换联系方式，成为朋友后，他们还会介绍新朋友来扩大圈子，如果不想浪费太多时间，必须得精心选择几个来深入交流。最重要的是，这些朋友是我选的，能理解我的追求，甚至和我目标一致且与我并肩努力。

另外有了爱好你根本不需要过多的社会关系，绝大部分时间我都喜欢独处，比如微信读书看了几百本书，豆瓣标记了两千多部电影，如果我想在书和电影上交流，那我更愿意上豆瓣评论。

## 丁克老了之后不好过
这个观点其实大部分人亲身反对了，因为他们的非丁克父母老了也不好过。作为孩子需要离家去大城市打工，偶尔过节回家，并且他们精力主要投入在自己的孩子身上，很难照顾到老人。

老了之后孩子会不会对你好暂且不说，谈谈健康和养老问题。一般人会投入 30-50 岁这段人生来养孩子，65 岁可能身体状况就会变差。很多 30 岁左右的打工人就会出现肥胖、三高、腰椎间盘突出之类的病，我目前四十多岁也还没有任何病症，主因是运动量大，睡眠充足。并不是说多运动就能不得病，只是概率会小得多。另外我的体脂 10%左右，正手引体向上 30 个以上，全马 310 ，相信即使到 70 岁也会比大多数 30 岁的人身体素质好，还需要在意养老问题吗？因为我主要玩耐力运动和攀岩，体重不大，肌肉不多，外表显年轻，很多陌生人会误以为我二十多岁，这可能也是丁克的一大优势。

## 丁克就不应该结婚
持这种观点的人没有理解国外同性恋婚姻合法追求的是什么，肯定也是理解不了各种平权斗争的。而且婚姻的法律效益带来的不仅是心理上的安全感，它是和重疾险类似的一个保障，你目前再幸福也无法保证婚姻是永远稳定的。

另外婚姻带来了稳定的关系，大量论文都证实了稳定关系对健康的巨大收益，各种心理学书籍比如《亲密关系》也讲过。

## 选择丁克的男人就应该去结扎
这种观点本身就是非黑即白的，如同“如果你不喜欢开车，那你就把驾驶执照注销”一样极端。

首先说明我本身明白结扎不会影响身体健康，并且乐意结扎，但一直没结扎是因为老婆不让。之前说过我们本身喜欢孩子，如果哪天政|府变得像北欧、冰岛那样民主法治，我们很可能会生，当然我知道概率比中六合彩要小。

生育是两个人的事情，只要商量一致，没什么不可以的。</p>

                <li>If you refuse to reproduce and inherit, the future of the country will have nothing to do with you, then your opinions will be meaningless to the future of the country, and the country cannot and will not be handed over to you. This sentence is funny. Why not raise the point even higher: If you refuse to reproduce and inherit, the future of mankind will have nothing to do with you; if you refuse to reproduce and inherit, the future of mammals will have nothing to do with you; if you refuse to reproduce and inherit, the future of life on Earth will have nothing to do with you...🤣<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>如果你拒绝繁衍和传承，国家的未来将与你无关，那你的意见对国家的未来将毫无意义，国家不能也不会交到你们手里。这句话很搞笑，为什么不再拔高点：如果你拒绝繁衍和传承，人类的未来将与你无关；如果你拒绝繁衍与传承，哺乳动物的未来将与你无关；如果你拒绝繁衍和传承，地球生物的未来将与你无关。。。🤣</details></li><li>Well written, each argument is logically clear, and you can only respect others if you respect yourself. Therefore, I think that even if such people are not childfree, they will fully respect children. On the contrary, those who talk about family responsibility and social responsibility every day cannot even give basic respect to children and only treat them as their own appendages, lifelong toys, and investment targets. (The vast majority, not all).<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>写的不错，每个论点都逻辑清晰，尊重自己才能尊重他人，所以我觉得这类人就算不丁克也是会充分尊重小孩儿的，反而真正嘴里天天喊着家庭责任、社会责任的人，连基本的尊重小孩儿都做不到，只当做自己的附属品、终身玩偶、投资标的。（绝大部分，非全部）</details></li><li>Being childfree is not selfish, at least it&#x27;s better than parents who preach righteousness. Every reason they have for having children is selfish.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>丁克不自私，至少比嘴上挂着大义的父母好多了。他们生孩子的每一个理由都是自私的。</details></li><li>Looking at some of the replies above, I suddenly want to ask a question: What are your opinions on homosexuality? Is there a correct answer to whether to be childfree, to marry, or to like the same or opposite sex? I think this is the same type of question as whether to eat sweet or salty tofu pudding, or sweet or savory rice dumplings. Just eat what you like! The biggest difference with the childfree issue is that you can&#x27;t regret it. Today I eat sweet tofu pudding, and tomorrow I can switch camps to the salty tofu pudding party. But once a child is born, you can&#x27;t put them back, or it&#x27;s too late or you can&#x27;t have them when you get older, and it&#x27;s difficult to change camps. No one has walked the other person&#x27;s path, so no one can verify which path is better. The funny thing is that some people may regret it, but they don&#x27;t dare to admit that they chose the wrong path, so they desperately try to prove that their choice is the best choice. But back to the original question: Is there a correct answer to this choice? Looking at the posts these past few days, I think some people think there is a correct answer and they want to prove that their choice is correct. But I don&#x27;t think so: there&#x27;s no such thing as the best choice; you can&#x27;t even define what is good. There may be people on both sides who feel personally attacked and want to criticize me, &quot;pretending to be neutral,&quot; &quot;which path did you take, and do you regret it?&quot; I&#x27;m not that old yet and still have the opportunity to make a choice, so I can&#x27;t say which path I will ultimately take, and I can&#x27;t say whether I will regret the path I take in the future. But, no matter what choice I make, it&#x27;s none of other people&#x27;s business, and it&#x27;s even less the business of the national government. Whether I reproduce or not, I pay taxes, and my opinion is meaningful to the country; I don&#x27;t really care about the country&#x27;s long-term future, but I care about the country&#x27;s present and limited future; I demand to enjoy the rights that the government provides citizens because I fulfill the obligations I am required to fulfill, and this obligation does not seem to include that I must reproduce. Likewise, whether or not I reproduce has nothing to do with the national government - I agree with most of what the original poster said, but I cannot agree with the parts about lying flat and the political government - nor is it related to building social relationships as mentioned in the previous post. If I&#x27;m not sure I can raise a child well, then I won&#x27;t have one. Don&#x27;t even talk about having children; for the past seven or eight years, I&#x27;ve been drifting around outside, and I haven&#x27;t even adopted a pet until this year when I have a place to live and I had the idea of raising a pet. If I choose to have children, it will definitely be because I&#x27;m sure I can raise the child well. Whether or not to have children has nothing to do with all other factors, only with that child. Because you&#x27;re worried about being unhappy in your old age, so you have a child just in case? Because you have few social relationships in the second half of your life and need to build new social relationships, so you have a child? Because you&#x27;re worried that raising children will affect your life too much, so you don&#x27;t have children? Isn&#x27;t that too selfish?! Because you&#x27;re worried that the living environment is too harsh, so you don&#x27;t dare to have children? Isn&#x27;t that too unconfident?! To explain a little more, I don&#x27;t know if you can understand what I mean by raising children. Because my grandmother&#x27;s idea is that having and raising children is all about feeding them. I can&#x27;t agree with her idea. To be called raising, it should be more about whether I can become a qualified parent and whether I can raise this life to be a qualified person. Of course, these two qualifications are also difficult to define precisely. I now admit that I am not qualified enough, and I don&#x27;t think I can even be a qualified partner, let alone a qualified parent. So I&#x27;m temporarily choosing not to marry or have children. If one day I feel I&#x27;m qualified and meet a suitable partner, I may change my mind. But it looks hopeless at the moment.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我看楼上的一些回复，突然想问一句：大家对同性恋什么看法？丁不丁克，结不结婚，喜欢同性还是异性，有正确答案吗？我觉得这与豆腐脑吃甜的还是咸的，粽子吃甜的还是咸的是同一类问题。爱吃什么就吃什么呗！丁克与否问题最大的不同是不能后悔。我今天吃甜豆腐脑，明天可以换阵营到咸豆腐脑党。但是孩子生下来塞不回去，或者年纪大了就来不及了、生不了了，阵营很难更改。谁也没走过对方的路，所以谁也不无法验证哪条路更好。搞笑的是，有些人可能会后悔，但又不敢承认自己选错了路，于是拼命要证明自己的选择才是最好的选择。但是回到最初的问题：这个选择有正确答案吗？看这几天的帖子，我觉得有些人认为有正确答案，他们要证明自己的选择没错。但我不这么认为：有个屁的最好的选择，连什么是好都无法定义。可能双方都有对号入座的人，都要踩我，「假装理中客」「那你是走了哪条路，你有没有后悔？」我还不算年迈，还有机会做选择，所以我也不好说我最终会走哪条路，也说不准以后会不会后悔走的那条路。但是，无论我做什么选择，都不干其他人的事儿，更不干国家政府的事儿。无论我是否繁衍传承，我都在纳税，我的意见对国家就有意义；我确实不关心国家长远的未来，但我关心国家的现在和有限期的未来；我要求享受政府提供给公民的权利是因为我履行了该履行的义务，而这个义务里似乎并不包括我必须繁衍。同样，无论我是否要繁衍，也与国家政府无关——我认同楼主所说的大部分内容，但有关躺平和政治政府的部分无法认同——也与之前那个帖子所说的建立社会关系无关。如果我不能确定我可以养育好一个孩子，那么我就不会生。别说生孩子，前面七八年在外边一直漂着，我连宠物都没有领养，直到今年我算是有个住所了我才动了养只宠物的念头。如果我选择生孩子，那肯定是我能确定我可以养育好孩子了。生不生孩子与其他所有的因素都无关，只与那个孩子有关。因为担心晚年不快乐不幸福所以要生个孩子以防万一？因为人生后半段社会关系少需要建立新的社会关系所以生个孩子？因为担心养育孩子太影响自己的生活所以不生孩子？这也太自私了吧？！因为担心生活环境太恶劣所以不敢生孩子？这样太不自信了吧？！多解释一句，我所谓的养育孩子，不知道你们能不能理解。因为我奶奶的观念是，生孩子养孩子嘛，养活就行。我无法认同她这个观念。说是养育，更应该说是我能不能成为一个合格的父母，能不能让这个生命养成为一个合格的人。当然，这里的两个合格也很难精确定义。我现在自认我还不够合格，别说做合格的父母，连做合格的伴侣我都认为我做不到。所以我现在暂时还是选择不婚，不生。如果哪天我自觉我够格了，同时遇到了合适的伴侣，我也许会改变主意。不过目前看起来，此生无望。</details></li><li>@w99wjacky I&#x27;ll respond on behalf of the Americans (imaginary dialogue): LOL, you have kids and the country will hand the future over to you?

The U.S. economy took off, but the result of economic development wasn&#x27;t to put shackles on Americans, right? Shouldn&#x27;t the result of economic development be to make people more free? It should be free to post this kind of thing in the U.S. (V2EX servers in the U.S.), and it should be free to choose whether to have children or not, right? Study the U.S. Constitution for a bit. 3. If a country is truly strong, would it still be afraid of no one having kids? So many people are clamoring to give birth in the U.S., so why would it be afraid of childfree people? 4.
