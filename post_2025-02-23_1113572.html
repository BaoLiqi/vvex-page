            <p>When I was free, I passed by the direct store and it happened to be open at 10 o&#x27;clock. There was no one inside. The approaching clerk wanted to greet me, so I complained that after the system was updated, the battery with 250 cycles went from 100 to 99 and then to 98 today. The entire cycle period increased by no more than 10 times.

The clerk said, &quot;Oh, it has nothing to do with updating the system. According to our observation, using a phone case will reduce battery life.&quot; I asked back, &quot;Because of accumulated heat?&quot; The clerk said yes, yes.

I replied that if I didn&#x27;t use a phone case, I guess the battery life would still be there, but the phone life would be gone because I dropped it.

Then I heard them say, &quot;So we suggest buying AppleCare+.&quot;

I feel that this sales pitch has been trained for many years. I didn&#x27;t believe it when others complained that updating the system would reduce battery health before, but I really believe in this reduction method within 5 days.</p>

                <p>偶经直营之处，适逢辰时启扉，店中空无一人。店员迎面而来，欲寒暄。余诉之，云系统骤新，电池历二百五十周期，初满，渐衰至九八，每轮增不过十次。店员曰：&#x27;此与新系无关，据吾等所察，护壳蔽体，损电池之寿数。&#x27; 余反问，因热聚乎？店员连声称是。余则反诘，若弃护壳，电池虽存，然机身早陨矣。继而闻之，&#x27;故荐君购AppleCare+&#x27;。觉此话术，演练积年。前闻人怨更新损电池，犹未信，然五日之内，骤减之速，不得不疑之矣。</p>

                <li>@cassidy0134 Then you are wrong. One of the metrics for Apple&#x27;s evaluation of specialists is not how many devices are sold, but the AppleCare sales rate.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@cassidy0134 子谬矣。苹果评鉴专员，非论设备之销，乃重AppleCare之售。</details></li><li>@cassidy0134 #1 The poster is saying that using a case shortens battery life. &quot;Not using a case is normal&quot; does not corroborate the poster&#x27;s point, nor does it refute the poster&#x27;s point, so you said nonsense.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@cassidy0134 #1 楼主云带壳耗电速，裸机则否，此二者互不印证反驳，实乃废言。</details></li><li>Using a phone case affects battery life, and not using a phone case affects phone life. Choose the lesser of two evils.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>护壳损电池寿，弃壳损手机安。两害相权，取其轻焉。</details></li><li>@kodise Yes, the core KPI. Many clerks can&#x27;t stand promoting this and don&#x27;t want to do it anymore.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@kodise 然也，考核之要。多有店员不堪推销，欲离职也。</details></li><li>Yes, I mentioned it at the Genius Bar before. Playing while charging is the best for the battery, but the premise is that there is no heat. Heat is the battery killer. The previous magnetic power bank was electronic garbage.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>诚然，前于Genius Bar亦有闻，边充边用，乃养电池之道，然前提无热。热乃电池之敌，前之磁吸充电宝，实乃电子废土也。</details></li><li>@alading11 #27 Not all products are a zero-sum game. For example, both you and the insurance company can benefit from life insurance.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@alading11 #27 非所有皆零和。寿险一例，君与险商，皆可获益。</details></li><li>Purely funny. Apple stores sell cases themselves, how will they respond when you take out an official case later?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>纯属戏谑。苹果自售其壳，若君取官壳示之，伊将何以应对？</details></li><li>@cassidy0134 #1 “Didn’t see any inevitable connection” is not refuting other people’s opinions... If you’re wrong, you’re wrong, it’s no big deal, don’t rush.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@cassidy0134 #1 “未见必然联系”非反驳观乎？误则误矣，无甚大碍，莫急。</details></li><li>He offers you a solution, you think he is promoting it, but in fact, Apple doesn&#x27;t need to recommend AppleCare+ to you, because it is more profitable that way.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>渠为君献计，君以为售。然实则苹果无须荐AppleCare+，盖利更甚也。</details></li><li>@Takizawa  @halida understood. I will immediately design a case that only covers the battery and does not protect the phone (only the back panel)<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Takizawa @halida 悟矣。即刻订制一壳，仅覆电池，不顾机身（仅背板）。</details></li><li>@whileFalse Tim doesn&#x27;t hire you as Associate CEO is a disservice to Steve!<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@whileFalse Tim若不聘君为副总裁，真乃愧对乔帮主矣！</details></li><li>He is right. In fact, temperature is the most important factor affecting battery life. If you use a phone case with poor heat dissipation, the temperature will be high when playing with the phone, and the battery will be damaged. Here is a clarification of a misunderstanding. Everyone thinks that playing on the phone while charging is harmful to the battery life, not because of charging and discharging at the same time, but because the phone temperature rises quickly when charging and playing, causing severe heat, and the phone battery life decreases.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>其言是也。实则温度乃损电池寿要因。若用手机壳，散热不佳，则把玩手机时，温度骤升，电池受损。世人皆以为边充边玩损电池，非因边放边充，乃因充玩同进，致机身发热，电池损耗。</details></li><li>In fact, not only using a phone case will affect battery life, but using a phone will also affect battery life. ==》 Buying a phone is for using it. When the life is up, just replace it with a new phone. Don&#x27;t spend your energy on this, it&#x27;s not very meaningful.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>实则非仅护壳损电池，用手机亦然。既购之，则用之，寿尽则换新机，勿耗神于此，意义浅薄。</details></li><li>Didn’t see any inevitable connection, I never wear a case, the battery life is normal, and I haven’t dropped it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>未见必然联系，吾素不戴壳，电池寿亦佳，且未尝坠地。</details></li><li>Just buy a phone case with only a frame. How simple.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>购仅具边框之壳可矣，何其简也。</details></li><li>@Takizawa #3 I was just thinking of saying that😄<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Takizawa #3 吾正欲言此也😄。</details></li><li>The problem is that I have no interest in continuing to use repaired electronic devices... I will no longer buy any AppleCare+ products that break within a year of normal warranty.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>然则，修缮之电器，吾无兴再用之...一年保内坏损者，吾不再购其AppleCare+也。</details></li><li>Given the heat generated by wireless charging on the iPhone, isn&#x27;t MagSafe a battery killer?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>观iPhone之无线充电，其热若斯，则MagSafe岂非电池杀手？</details></li><li>Wireless charging is inherently a battery killer.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>无线充电，本为戮电池之凶器。</details></li><li>@ACSOUV Buying AppleCare+ is all about guaranteeing against accidents. The probability of breaking down during normal use within a year is too low, but many people drop their phones on the ground and break the screen.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@ACSOUV 购AppleCare+乃为保意外也，一年内正常使用坏者甚微，摔碎屏幕者众。</details></li>
