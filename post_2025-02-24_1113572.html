        <h1>When I heard an Apple store employee say that using a phone case will affect battery life</h1>
        <h2>当听到苹果店员说，用手机壳会影响电池寿命</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I happened to pass by a direct store when it opened at 10 o'clock, there was no one inside, and the clerk who came up to me wanted to greet me, so I complained that I had just updated the system, and the battery with 250 cycles went from 100 to 99 and then to 98 today, and the entire cycle period increased by no more than 10 times.

The clerk said that it has nothing to do with the system update. According to our observation, using a mobile phone case will reduce battery life. I asked back, because of the accumulation of heat? The clerk said yes, yes.

I replied that if I didn't use a mobile phone case, I guess the battery life would still be there, but the life of the mobile phone would be gone if I dropped it.

Then I heard them say, so we recommend buying AC.

I feel that this rhetoric has been trained for many years. I didn't believe it when others complained that updating the system would reduce battery health before, but I really believe this method of reduction within 5 days.</p>
            <p>闲来无事经过直营店的时候刚好 10 点开门，里面没人，迎面而来的店员想跟我寒暄，我就吐槽说刚更新系统，250 次循环的电池从 100 到 99 再到今天 98 ，整个循环周期增加不超过 10 次。

店员说，哎呀和更新系统无关，根据我们观察，使用手机壳会减少电池寿命。我反问，因为堆积热量？店员说是啊是啊。

我回复要是不用手机壳，估计电池寿命还在，手机寿命就给我摔没了。

然后就听到说，所以我们建议购买 ac 啊。

感觉这话术已经培训多年。之前别人吐槽更新系统给降低电池健康度我还不信，5 天之内这个降低法我还真信了。</p>

                <li>@cassidy0134 Then you are wrong. One of the indicators for Apple's specialist evaluation is not how many devices are sold, but the AC sales rate.<br>@cassidy0134 那你就错了，苹果评估 specialist 的指标之一，不是卖了多少设备，而是 ac 销售率。</li><li>@cassidy0134 #1 The poster is saying that using a case shortens battery life. "Normal without a case" does not corroborate the poster's point of view, nor does it refute the poster's point of view, so you said something useless.<br>@cassidy0134 #1 楼主是说带壳缩短电池寿命，「不带壳正常」并不能佐证楼主的观点，也不能反驳楼主的观点，所以你说了一句废话。</li><li>Using a mobile phone case affects battery life, and not using a mobile phone case affects the life of the mobile phone. Choose the lesser of two evils.<br>用手机壳影响电池寿命，不用手机壳会影响手机寿命，两害相权取其轻。</li><li>@kodise Yes, it is a core KPI indicator. Many clerks can't stand promoting this and don't want to do it anymore.<br>@kodise 是的，KPI 的核心指标。很多店员都受不了推销这个不想干了。</li><li>Yes, I went to the genius bar before and said that charging while playing is the best for the battery, but the premise is that there is no heat, and heat is the battery killer. The previous magnetic power bank was electronic waste.<br>是的 之前去 genius bar 说过了 边充边玩是对电池最好的 但是提前是没发热，发热才是电池杀手，之前的磁吸充电宝就是电子垃圾</li><li>@alading11 #27 Not all products are zero-sum games. For example, with life insurance, you and the insurance company can both benefit from it.<br>@alading11 #27 不一定所有产品都是零和博弈，举个例子人寿保险你和保险公司都能从中获利。</li><li>Just funny. Apple stores sell cases themselves. How will they respond when you take out an official case later?<br>纯属搞笑。水果店自己都卖壳，等会你掏出一个官壳来他又如何应对</li><li>@cassidy0134 #1 "I don't see any inevitable connection" isn't that refuting someone else's point of view... If you're wrong, you're wrong, it's not a big deal, don't be anxious.<br>@cassidy0134 #1 “没看出来什么必然联系”，不就是在反驳别人观点吗... 说错了就错了，没什么大不了的，不要急。</li><li>They are helping you come up with a solution, and you think they are selling it to you, but in reality, Apple doesn't need to recommend AC to you, because it makes more money this way.<br>ta 帮你提出解决方案，你觉得 ta 在推销，但实际上，苹果没有必要向你推荐 ac ，因为这样更赚</li><li>@Takizawa @halida Got it. I'll design a case that only covers the battery and doesn't protect the phone (only the back panel).<br>@Takizawa  @halida 懂了 马上设计一个只捂着电池不保护手机的壳子（只有背板）</li><li>@whileFalse Tim would be letting Steve down if he didn't hire you as Associate CEO!<br>@whileFalse Tim 不雇佣你做 Associate CEO 真对不起 Steve ！</li><li>He's right. In fact, temperature is the most important factor affecting battery life. If you use a mobile phone case and the heat dissipation is not good, the temperature will be high when playing with the mobile phone, and the battery will be greatly damaged. Here, I want to clarify a misconception. The reason why everyone thinks that playing with the mobile phone while charging is harmful to the battery life is not because of charging and discharging at the same time, but because the temperature of the mobile phone rises rapidly when charging and playing, which leads to serious heat generation and reduced mobile phone battery life.<br>他说的对，实际上温度是影响电池寿命最重要因素，你带手机壳，散热不好的话，玩手机时候温度就高，电池受到损耗就大。这里澄清一个误区，大家认为充电玩手机有害手机电池寿命，不是因为边充边放电，而且因为冲电玩手机手机温度上升的很快导致发热严重，手机电池寿命下降。</li><li>In fact, not only will using a mobile phone case affect battery life, but using a mobile phone will also affect battery life. ==> You buy a mobile phone to use it, and when it reaches the end of its life, you just replace it with a new one. Don't spend your energy on it, it's not very meaningful.<br>其实不仅用手机壳会影响电池寿命，用手机也会影响电池寿命。==》 买了手机就是用的，寿命到了就换新手机就是了，别把精力花在这上面，意义不大</li><li>I don't see any inevitable connection. I never wear a case, and the battery life is normal, and I haven't dropped it.<br>没看出来什么必然联系，我从不戴壳，电池寿命也正常，也没有摔过</li><li>Just buy a mobile phone case with only a frame. Simple as that.<br>买只有边框的手机壳就好了呀。多简单。</li><li>@Takizawa #3 I was just about to say that😄<br>@Takizawa #3 我正想这么说😄</li><li>The problem is that I'm not interested in continuing to use repaired electronic devices... I won't buy products that break down within one year under normal warranty, so I no longer buy any ACs.<br>问题是修过的电子设备我是没兴趣继续用的……一年正常保内就坏的产品不会再买所以现在我已经不再购买任何 AC 了</li><li>With the heat generated by iPhone's wireless charging, isn't MagSafe a battery killer?<br>就 iPhone 那个无线充电的发热量，MagSafe 岂不是电池杀手？</li><li>Wireless charging is inherently a battery killer.<br>无线充电本来就是电池杀手。</li><li>@ACSOUV Buying AC is all about protecting against accidents. The probability of breaking down under normal use within a year is too low, but there are quite a few cases of screens breaking when dropped on the ground.<br>@ACSOUV 买 AC 都是冲着保意外的啊，一年内正常使用坏掉的概率太低了，摔地上碎屏的倒是不少。</li>
