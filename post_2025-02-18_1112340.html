        <div class="content">
            <p>Due to the severe patriarchal mindset, the 100,000 yuan bride price that was verbally promised to be returned is now not being given. Can the couple sue their parents to get it back?

I don&#x27;t know if there is any audio evidence of the previous verbal promise. Recent chat records show that he directly said that the debt will not be paid. Can this be used as direct evidence to sue and get it back?

A similar case is here: https://wenshu.court.gov.cn/website/wenshu/181107ANFZ0BXSK4/index.html?docId=pl5PTLOzdgk6/KN7b1FW5MKA1bjKN21Mf789LNNAUnrnDGvEdDUvQvUKq3u+IEo4fFmPNBQpL94jS5Iai5fOqHt8hPAwc2+Y72q8nYjlNVOWEgBklO+jM2xhX6q35F/2</p>

                <p>由于重男轻女的思想太严重，之前口头答应的会返回的 10w 彩礼钱现在不给了，夫妻双方能否起诉父母要回来？

之前口头承诺会给的不知道还有没有语音证据，最近的聊天记录显示他直接说的是欠的不给了，能否作为直接证据进行起诉要回来。

Most likely, they are parents themselves, who also have daughters and are patriarchal, and they are triggered seeing so many people not supporting parents pocketing bride price money.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Erroad #23 楼上几位不可能是🐢，大概率是自己作为父母，也是有女儿且重男轻女的，看到这么多人不支持父母私吞彩礼钱破防了。</details></li><li>You must sue them. Who told you to be patriarchal? Is the son human, but the daughter isn&#x27;t? When they&#x27;re old, let the son take care of them. If they don&#x27;t return the bride price, let them live inside hahaha. I&#x27;m dying of laughter, I really can&#x27;t help it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>必须起诉他们，谁叫你们重男轻女，儿子就是人？女儿就不是了？老了直接让儿子养老呗，不退换彩礼，直接让他们去里面养老哈哈哈 笑死我了，实在忍不住</details></li><li>@Erroad This is how domestic 🐢 are.

Then I would choose to have in-depth communication with them. Even if they don&#x27;t return it, I&#x27;ll accept it, and just pretend that my parents never promised to return it. Parents also make mistakes sometimes. It is normal for parents and children to have quarrels and arguments. Unless absolutely necessary, don&#x27;t go down the path of litigation.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我的观点：也许父母做的不对，之前承诺要返还彩礼，但没有返回。那么我会选择和他们进行深入的沟通。即使还不还，那我心里不舒服也认了，就当父母之前没答应过返还。父母也有做错的时候。父母子女之间有吵架，有争论很正常。不到万不得已，还是不要走起诉这条路吧。</details></li>
