            <p>- Because I travel frequently on business trips, I use Didi Taxi very often.
- Now nine out of ten taxis are electric cars. I rarely get motion sickness in gasoline cars, but I start to get motion sickness when electric car drivers drive a little faster. Although it&#x27;s not to the point of vomiting, it&#x27;s still very uncomfortable.
- I have also had experiences where I didn&#x27;t get motion sickness, because the driver drove very steadily and not fast.
- Although I know that I won&#x27;t get motion sickness if I drive myself, I have to consider others when buying a car, and the comfort of the ride. This makes me a little less interested in electric cars.
- Many colleagues around me also get motion sickness in electric cars.</p>

                <p>- 因为经常出差的缘故，滴滴打车使用频率较高。
- 打车现在是十车九电，油车很少晕车，电车司机但凡开的快一点，就开始晕车，虽然没到吐得程度，但也很不舒服。
- 也有不晕车的经历，就是开的特别稳，不快那种。
- 虽然知道自己开不会晕，但是买车肯定要考虑别人，入座的舒适性，这样让我有点对电车扣分。
- 身边也有很多同事，坐电车也会晕车。</p>

                <li>Turn on kinetic energy recovery, and try to sit in the front seat as much as possible.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>开动能回收了吧，尽量做前座</details></li><li>There&#x27;s a feature on iPhone called Car Motion Hints. When turned on, if the vehicle is in motion, there will be small dots on the screen, which is very useful for preventing dizziness. I used to get very dizzy playing on my phone in the car, but now I can play without any problems.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>iPhone 上有个功能，叫车俩运动提示。开启之后，如果车辆在动的话，屏幕上会有小点点，防晕特别有用。本人之前在车内玩手机特别晕，现在随便玩。</details></li><li>Tell the driver to drive steadily when you get in the car, otherwise you are not responsible if you vomit.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>上车就跟司机说开稳一点，否则吐了概不负责</details></li><li>I feel that electric car drivers drive with one foot on the accelerator and one foot on the brake, which is indeed easy to cause motion sickness.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>感觉电车司机都是一脚电门一脚刹车的开，确实很容易晕</details></li><li>Many electric cars have kinetic energy recovery, and the acceleration is already strong, so it&#x27;s hard not to get motion sickness.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>电车好多都开动力回收，加之加速本来就猛，很难不晕车的。</details></li><li>1. The main reason is the bad air in the car. 2. Many Didi drivers are not experienced drivers... 3. Because they are on the road for a long time, they are very good at cutting in line and worry about being cut off, so they always jerk forward. 4. Although, if you are not stepping on the gas pedal, your foot should be on the brake... those who lightly step on the brake for no reason have had their brains squeezed by the door. These are the reasons above.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>1. 车内空气臭其实是主要原因2. 滴滴司机，很多并不是老司机。。。3. 因为长期在路上跑，很擅长插队和担心被加塞，所以，总是一窜一窜4. 虽然，不踩油门，脚就应该放刹车上，但是。。。没事就微踩刹车的就是脑子被门夹过了。以上</details></li><li>Accordion foot, stepping on the accelerator makes it lurch forward, and releasing the accelerator decelerates it. Back and forth, shaking and shaking, it&#x27;s disgusting.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>风琴脚，油门一踩就窜，油门一收就减速，一前一后一摇一摇，恶心的一批</details></li><li>Garbage kinetic energy recovery, it&#x27;s so uncomfortable that you want to die.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>垃圾动能回收 都难受的要死</details></li><li>1. Electric car drivers prefer to sleep in the car (for safety), which makes the smell worse. 2. There is kinetic energy recovery to save money. 3. They are not traditional drivers, they just drive randomly, it&#x27;s cheap, they don&#x27;t pursue the experience, and their goal is to arrive quickly (Tesla is still a premium car, but it&#x27;s terribly bad, ugh, I don&#x27;t even want to take it for express money).<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>1 电车司机更喜欢在车里睡觉（安全），加重味道2 有动能回收，为了省钱3 出身不是传统司机，就是瞎开，便宜，不追求体验，以快速到达为准（特斯拉还专车级别，垃圾的要命，呸，快车钱我都不想坐）</details></li><li>@MeteorVIP Play it out loud<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@MeteorVIP 外放</details></li><li>I can&#x27;t either. When I take my wife and children, I call a premium car. If the license plate number shows that it&#x27;s an electric car, I cancel the order and reorder.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我也不行，带老婆孩子就打专车，看车牌号是电车的话就取消再下一单。</details></li><li>I never get motion sickness in transportation, but last year I was made to vomit by a Didi driver driving a Dongfeng electric car (after getting out of the car).<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我从来不晕交通工具的，去年被一个开东风电车的滴滴司机整吐了（下车后）。</details></li><li>Not to mention electric cars, when I take a Didi at night, I often get a Accord, and the driver steps on the gas hard, wanting to get to the destination in one go, and my head hurts when I get out of the car.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>别说电车，晚上打滴滴经常打到雅阁，司机猛踩，巴不得一脚到目的地，下车脑袋疼</details></li><li>The cure is to sit more often, and you will get used to it and won&#x27;t get motion sickness anymore. If you don&#x27;t want to feel uncomfortable, remind the driver that you get motion sickness and to drive steadily when you get in the car.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>治的话就是多坐，习惯了就不晕了不想难受的话，上车就提醒司机自己晕车，开车稳一点</details></li><li>The main reason is kinetic energy recovery, which is equivalent to the reverse charging of electric scooters. Ask the driver to adjust the kinetic energy recovery to the lowest setting, or to the comfort setting.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>主要原因是动能回收，相当于电摩的反充电。让司机把动能回收调最低，或者调成舒适。</details></li><li>Me too, taking a taxi out to play really affects the experience. By the time I get there, I&#x27;m already dizzy and don&#x27;t have the mood for anything.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我也是，打车出去玩特别影响体验，到了地方人已经晕完，都没什么心情了</details></li><li>Sit in the passenger seat, look ahead and don&#x27;t look at your phone. Understand the principle of motion sickness. I saw it before. It&#x27;s probably because the direction of balance seen by the eyes is inconsistent with what a system inside the ear feels.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>坐副驾，看前面不要看手机。了解一下晕车原理，之前看过，大概是因为眼睛看到的平衡方向和耳朵里面一个系统感受到的不一致。</details></li><li>Look out the window<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>看窗外</details></li><li>Open the window and sleep soundly<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>开窗户 睡大觉</details></li><li>I remembered that I have to take a taxi later, and my head is starting to spin..<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我想起来一会要打车,头就开始晕了..</details></li>
