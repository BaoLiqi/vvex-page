        </details>
        <div class="content">
            <p>- Due to frequent business trips, I use Didi Taxi quite often.
- Now nine out of ten taxis are electric. I rarely get motion sickness in gasoline cars, but as soon as an electric car driver drives a little faster, I start to feel sick, although not to the point of vomiting, but very uncomfortable.
- I have also had experiences where I didn&#x27;t get motion sickness, which was when the driver drove very steadily and not fast.
- Although I know I won&#x27;t get motion sickness if I drive myself, I definitely have to consider others when buying a car, the comfort of sitting, which makes me deduct points for electric cars.
- Many colleagues around me also get motion sickness in electric cars.</p>

                <p>- 常因公远游，滴滴行车频矣。
- 今之车，十之有九为电驱。燃油车少有晕者，电车稍迅，则觉不适，虽未至呕吐，亦颇难忍。
- 亦有不晕者，驾驭甚稳，速不疾也。
- 知自驾则安，然购车当虑及他人乘坐之感，此令吾于电车略有微词。
- 诸同僚亦有乘电车而晕者，恐非孤例。</p>

The smelly air in the car is actually the main reason 2. Many Didi drivers are not experienced drivers... 3. Because they run on the road for a long time, they are good at cutting in line and worrying about being cut in, so they always dart forward and backward 4. Although, you should put your foot on the brake when you are not stepping on the gas, but... those who tap the brake from time to time have their heads twisted by the door. above<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>车内秽气乃主因也。滴滴司机，多非老手。长奔于路，善于插队，惧被加塞，故常窜动。虽不踩油门，足当置于刹车之上，然没事就微踩者，殆脑有所疾也。</details></li><li>Accordion foot, the accelerator is stepped on and it rushes, the accelerator is retracted and decelerated, back and forth, shaking, disgusting batch<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>风琴脚，油门一踩便窜，一收即缓，前后摇摆，令人作呕。</details></li><li>Garbage kinetic energy recovery is so uncomfortable<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>动能回收，徒增难受。</details></li><li>1 Electric car drivers prefer to sleep in the car (safety), which worsens the smell 2 There is kinetic energy recovery, in order to save money 3 They were not traditional drivers, they just drive blindly, cheaply, without pursuing experience, taking rapid arrival as the standard (Tesla is also a special car level, rubbish to death, bah, I don’t even want to take a fast car)<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>电车驭者喜于车内假寐，气味更甚。具动能回收，为省资财。出身非传统驭者，多为瞎开，图便宜，不求体验，以速达为准（特斯拉亦不过尔尔，快车之资吾皆不欲乘）。</details></li><li>@MeteorVIP speaker<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@MeteorVIP 扬声</details></li><li>I can&#x27;t do it either.

Last year, I was vomited by a Didi driver driving a Dongfeng electric car (after getting off the car).<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾素不晕车，去岁，为一操东风电车之滴滴司机所吐（下车后）。</details></li><li>Don&#x27;t mention electric cars. I often hit Accord when driving Didi at night. The driver steps on it hard, wishing to reach the destination in one step. My head hurts when I get off the car.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>休言电车，夜间打车常遇雅阁，司机猛踩，恨不能一步登仙，下车头疼欲裂。</details></li><li>The cure is to sit more, get used to it and you won&#x27;t get motion sickness. If you don&#x27;t want to feel uncomfortable, remind the driver that you have motion sickness and drive steadily when you get in the car.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>疗法唯多乘，习之则不眩。若不欲难受，登车即告司机，吾晕行车，稳稳行驶。</details></li><li>The main reason is kinetic energy recovery, which is equivalent to the reverse charging of electric motorcycles. Let the driver adjust the kinetic energy recovery to the lowest level or to comfort.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>主因乃动能回收，如电摩之反充。令司机调动能回收至最低，或调至舒适。</details></li><li>Me too, taking a taxi to play really affects the experience. When I arrive, I am already dizzy and I am not in the mood.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾亦然，打车出游甚损兴致，至目的地，已晕头转向，了无心绪。</details></li><li>Sit in the passenger seat and look ahead instead of looking at your phone. Learn about the principle of motion sickness. I read it before, probably because the balance direction seen by the eyes is inconsistent with what a system in the ears feels.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>坐于副驾，望前莫看手机。略知晕车之理，盖因目视之平衡方向与耳内感知不合所致。</details></li><li>Look out the window<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>望向窗外</details></li><li>open the window have a nap<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>开窗，卧睡</details></li><li>I remembered that I had to take a taxi in a while, and my head started to spin..<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>忽忆须臾将乘车，头已觉晕矣...</details></li>
