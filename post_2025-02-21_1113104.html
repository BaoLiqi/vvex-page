                <li>Anyone can make things difficult by showing off. Can you explain some questions from the soft exam?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>卖弄玄虚，刁难他人，何人不会？汝能尽释软考之题否？</details></li><li>You don&#x27;t call it an algorithm question, it&#x27;s a recitation question. It&#x27;s not that people didn&#x27;t do it, it&#x27;s that they didn&#x27;t memorize it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此非算法之考，乃背诵之试！非彼等不能为，实乃未曾习得耳！</details></li><li>What questions to ask in an interview depends on what kind of talents your product/team needs. Interview questions that deviate from the needs will not attract talents suitable for the team.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>面试之题，当视乎产品/团队所需何等英才而定。脱离需求之面试，无异于缘木求鱼，难觅良才。</details></li><li>I can&#x27;t do it with five years of experience, but fresh graduates may be able to write it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>纵有五年之功，亦难解此惑；反观初出茅庐者，或可著手。</details></li><li>It reminds me that nearly ten years ago, when I just graduated and was looking for a job, I encountered LRU questions in the interview. I had never seen it before. The interviewer gave me enough patience and hints, step by step from data structure design, interface design to final coding implementation. It took more than an hour to complete the coding. I think this is the real code examination. The interviewer&#x27;s interviewing style also deeply affected me. Unfortunately, as more and more people do questions, the interview rhythm is getting faster and faster, and program interviews have become a test of doing questions, and there is no longer a solution to problems, so I now only ask data structure questions in interviews, not algorithm questions.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>忆昔十年之前，初涉职场，面试偶遇 LRU 之题，前所未见。面试者耐心指点，从构筑数据结构，设计接口直至最终实现，历时一余时方成。此乃真正之编码考察，其面试之风，至今仍影响吾。惜乎刷题之风日盛，面试节奏骤快，编程测试遂沦为题海检验，失却解决问题之真谛。故吾今面试，只问数据结构，不涉算法难题。</details></li><li>No, a bunch of people above say that LRU is difficult and pretentious? Isn&#x27;t this just a HashMap+doubly linked list? Even if you manually write hashmap and linked list, is this difficult? Some people also say that it is not used in work, then you might as well say &quot;Anyway, you can ask AI if you encounter something you don&#x27;t know&quot;. Interview is to examine your way of thinking. Give you the needs of LRU description. You implement according to the needs. What is the difference between this and receiving a need in your work? It means that you can&#x27;t do the requirements of LRU, but you can do everything other than this requirement?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>不然。诸位竟言 LRU 难且矫揉造作？此不过 HashMap 加双向链表之术耳。纵使手书 HashMap 与链表，又何难之有？或云工作中无用，然则不如云“遇难则问 AI 可矣”。面试者，考其思维之道也。予汝 LRU 之需求，汝当按需而为。此与工作中受命有何异哉？莫非汝能解旁求，而独困于 LRU 乎？</details></li><li>Algorithm questions are basically just boilerplate code, because this thing is rarely used in work, and it is forgotten over time. It can only be said that he has done this part in the interview experience, and if he has done this part, he will have the fate to become a colleague with you. If he doesn&#x27;t do it, he has no fate. To put it bluntly, it depends on luck. Generally speaking, you have to ask about the project and the project in detail. In terms of algorithms, I would ask the kind that can definitely be done, but different people have different effects, and the boundary conditions are slightly complicated to see how the boundary conditions are considered, and to see how careful they are at work.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>算法之题，乃八股也。此物工作中罕见，久而遗忘。不过考其是否曾习此经，若曾学之，则有缘与汝共事；若未及，则无此缘分。直言之，乃天命也。通常，当细询项目经验。问及算法，宜择必可解者，然不同之人所得效果或有异。所选之题，边界条件稍繁，观其思虑是否周全，亦可察其工作之细致程度。</details></li><li>For problems like LRU, whether you have done the questions before, whether you just graduated or have been working for 10 years, as long as you are still a programmer, you should be able to write it. You should know intuitively that you should use a doubly linked list + hashmap<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>LRU 之类问题，无论是否曾习题，不论初出茅庐抑或十年老朽，但凡身为程序猿，皆应能书之。直觉当告之，宜用双向链表加之 HashMap 也。</details></li><li>Should not be brushing the questions, I can&#x27;t write it if I don&#x27;t brush the questions<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>必未曾刷题也，若不勤加练习，吾亦难书。</details></li><li>When you actually use LRU Cache in a project, do you use a pure hand-crafted one or a mature third-party library with test cases?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>实战之中，若需 LRU 缓存，汝将手书代码，抑或用已测试之三方库？</details></li><li>Personally, I think it&#x27;s okay to be able to talk about the ideas, but now that the employment is so competitive, it&#x27;s okay to require the best solution and pass the test.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>鄙人以为，能条分缕析，阐明思路即可。然今就业竞争尤烈，要求给出最优解并通过测试，亦无可厚非。</details></li><li>You have to put the logic together in the question, it doesn&#x27;t feel difficult to just see if it is implemented<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>需将逻辑融于题目之中，仅观其是否实现，实不足为难。</details></li><li>Three years of experience may not be able to write it, but if you apply for internships and school recruits, you will definitely memorize it for you<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>三年之功者或难书之，然若面试实习生及应届生，必能倒背如流。</details></li><li>@SeaTac #39 You may be mistaken, LinkedHashMap is the LRU implementation, this is the documentation of this class: This implementation differs from HashMap in that it maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries. This linked list defines the encounter order (the order of iteration), which is normally the order in which keys were inserted into the map (insertion-order). The least recently inserted entry (the eldest) is first, and the youngest entry is last. Not enough LFU is indeed more troublesome, suitable for oral implementation ideas, I am not sure to write it right once.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@SeaTac #39 道友或有误，LinkedHashMap 方为 LRU 之实，详见其文档：This implementation differs from HashMap in that it maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries. This linked list defines the encounter order (the order of iteration), which is normally the order in which keys were inserted into the map (insertion-order). The least recently inserted entry (the eldest) is first, and the youngest entry is last. 不够 LFU 确为繁琐，宜口述思路，吾不敢保一次书成。</details></li><li>LRU is very simple, it is the kind of question that can be passed at first sight. I was given LFU when I was interviewing for Byte, and I was limited to 20-30 minutes. I still feel resentful.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>LRU 甚简，初见即过之题也。吾当时面字节跳动，竟出 LFU，还限时二三十分，至今仍耿耿于怀。</details></li><li>@yuanyao I usually look at project experience first, examine basic knowledge. Then let the interviewees talk about their workflow after getting a demand, and then combine a few business issues, so that I can probably understand the true level of this person and whether he has system design capabilities. This person can be trusted with a demand, whether his thinking is comprehensive, whether he is responsible, and whether he is reliable. Although most people are crud, writing code is different from writing maintainable engineering. There is nothing difficult about the code of most businesses now. What is important is the attitude towards a demand, whether you have your own ideas, and don&#x27;t dig holes for future generations.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@yuanyao 吾面试时常先观项目经历，考察基础知识。而后令面试者阐述领命后的操作步骤，再辅以数个业务问题，略可知其真水平与系统设计之能。其人是否可付之以重任，思考是否全面，负责与否，行事是否可靠。虽多数人皆为crud，然书写代码与书写可维护之工程迥异。今之业务代码，难处何在？要紧者，乃对待需求之态度，有无己见，勿为后人挖坑！</details></li><li>Very low, basic skills<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>甚低也，乃筑基之术耳。</details></li><li>How much is the salary range? I can do it hahaha<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>薪酬几何？吾可解之，哈哈！</details></li><li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t memorize this<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>或未曾背诵耳。</details></li><li>What qualities can a candidate represent by being able to write it? If this quality is what the position needs, it is reasonable<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>能书之，则此候选者可体现何种素质？若此素质为岗位所需，则合情合理也。</details></li>
