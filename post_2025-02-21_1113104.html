                <li>Anyone can make things difficult for others by showing off. Can you explain a few questions I randomly pick from the software exam?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>装 B 为难别人谁不会啊，我随便从软考找几道题你能说清楚？</details></li><li>That&#x27;s not an algorithm question, it&#x27;s a memorization question. It&#x27;s not that people can&#x27;t do it, it&#x27;s that they haven&#x27;t memorized it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你那不叫算法题，叫背诵题不是人家没没做出来，是人家没背诵出来</details></li><li>What questions to ask in an interview depends on what kind of talent your product/team needs. Interview questions that deviate from the requirements will not attract talent suitable for the team.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>面试出什么题目 问什么问题 是要看你们的产品/团队需要什么样的人才脱离需求的面试问题,也招不来适合团队的人才</details></li><li>Even with five years of experience, I can&#x27;t do it, but fresh graduates may be able to write it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>五年经验 也做不出来 倒是应届生有可能写出来</details></li><li>It reminds me of nearly ten years ago when I was a fresh graduate looking for a job. I encountered an LRU question in an interview that I had never seen before. The interviewer gave enough patience and prompts, step by step from data structure design, interface design to the final coding implementation. It took more than an hour to complete the coding and run successfully. I think this is a real coding test, and the interviewer&#x27;s style at that time also deeply influenced me. Unfortunately, later on, everyone did more and more problem-solving, the pace of interviews became faster and faster, and programming interviews became a test of problem-solving, without the assessment of problem-solving. So now I only give data structure questions in interviews, not algorithm questions.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>让我想起了在近十年前，我刚毕业找工作的时候，面试遇到 LRU 题目，从来没有见过，面试官给了足够的耐心和提示，一步步的从数据结构设计、接口设计到最终编码实现，整整花了一个多小时完成编码运行成功，我觉得这才是真正的编码考察，当时的面试官面试风格也深深的影响了我。可惜到后面大家刷题越来越多，面试节奏越来越快，编程面试成了刷题检验，没了解决问题的考察，所以我现在面试时只出数据结构题目，不出算法题目。</details></li><li>No, a bunch of people upstairs say LRU is difficult and showing off? Isn&#x27;t it just a HashMap + doubly linked list? Even if you manually code the hashmap and linked list, is that difficult? And some people say it&#x27;s not used in work, then you might as well say &quot;Just ask AI if you don&#x27;t know how to do it anyway.&quot; The interview is to test your way of thinking. If you describe the LRU requirements to you and you implement it according to the requirements, what&#x27;s the difference between that and accepting a requirement at work? Does that mean you can&#x27;t make the LRU requirement, but you can do everything else except this requirement?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>不是，楼上一堆人说 LRU 是难、装逼？这不就一个 HashMap+双向链表，就算全手撸 hashmap 和链表，这也叫难吗？还有说工作中用不到的，那你不如说“反正遇到不会的问 AI 就行了”。面试是考察你思维方式，给你描述 LRU 的需求，你按照需求去实现，这和你工作中接一个需求有什么区别？意思是 LRU 这个需求你做不出来，但是除了这个需求你其他的都能做得出来？</details></li><li>Testing algorithm problems is just boilerplate, because this thing is rarely used in work, and will be forgotten over time. It can only be said that his interview experience has done this part, and if he has done this part, he will have the fate to become a colleague with you, and if he hasn&#x27;t done it, he will have no fate. To put it bluntly, it depends on luck. Generally speaking, you should ask about the project and ask in more detail. For algorithms, ask about the kind that you can definitely do, but the results are different for different people, algorithms with slightly complicated boundary conditions, see how the boundary conditions are considered, and see the level of care in the work.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>考算法题就是八股文，因为这玩意工作中很难用到，久而久之就忘掉了，只能说他面经有没有做到这块，做到这块就有跟你成为同事的缘分了，没做到没缘分。说白了就是看运气。一般来说，要问项目，项目问的细一点。算法的话就问那种肯定能做出来，但是不同的人做出来的效果不太一样的算法，边界条件略微复杂的算法，看看边界条件考虑的怎么样，来看工作中的细心程度。</details></li><li>For LRU problems, whether you&#x27;ve practiced or not, whether you&#x27;re a new graduate or have worked for 10 years, as long as you&#x27;re still a programmer, you should be able to write it. Intuitively, you should know to use a doubly linked list + hashmap.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>像 LRU 这种问题，无论你刷没刷过题，刚毕业还是工作了 10 年，只要还在做程序员就应该能写出来。 从直觉上就应该知道用 doubly linked list + hashmap</details></li><li>Probably haven&#x27;t practiced LeetCode problems, I couldn&#x27;t write it without practicing either.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>应该没刷题吧, 没刷题我也写不出来</details></li><li>Do you manually implement an LRU Cache or use a mature third-party library with test cases in your actual projects?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你现在实际项目中用到 LRU Cache 的地方你是纯手搓一个还是用有测试用例的成熟的三方库？</details></li><li>Personally, I think it&#x27;s okay to be able to explain the idea, but now the job market is so competitive, it&#x27;s okay to require the optimal solution and pass the test...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>个人认为能讲出来思路就没问题，不过现在就业那么卷，要求给出最优解并且测试通过 也没问题。。。</details></li><li>You have to put the logic in the problem, it doesn&#x27;t seem difficult just to see if it&#x27;s implemented.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你要把逻辑一并放在题目中，只看是否实现感觉不难</details></li><li>A candidate with 3 years of experience may not be able to write it, but if you interview interns and new graduates, they will definitely memorize it for you.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>面三年的可能写不出来，但是你去面实习生和校招生，绝对给你背下来</details></li><li>@SeaTac #39 You may be mistaken, LinkedHashMap is the LRU implementation, this is the document of this class: This implementation differs from HashMap in that it maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries. This linked list defines the encounter order (the order of iteration), which is normally the order in which keys were inserted into the map (insertion-order). The least recently inserted entry (the eldest) is first, and the youngest entry is last. Not enough LFU is indeed more troublesome, suitable for oral implementation ideas, I am not sure to write it correctly at once.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@SeaTac #39 你可能记错了, LinkedHashMap 才是 LRU 实现啊, 这是这个类的文档:This implementation differs from HashMap in that it maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries. This linked list defines the encounter order (the order of iteration), which is normally the order in which keys were inserted into the map (insertion-order). The least recently inserted entry (the eldest) is first, and the youngest entry is last. 不够 LFU 确实麻烦点, 适合口述实现思路, 自己写我没把握一次写对.</details></li><li>LRU is very simple. It&#x27;s the kind of question you can pass at first sight. When I interviewed for ByteDance, they gave me LFU and limited me to 20-30 minutes. I still hold a grudge.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>LRU 很简单啊，属于那种初见就能过的题了我 TM 面字节的时候给我出 LFU ，还限制 20-30 分钟，我至今耿耿于怀</details></li><li>@yuanyao I usually look at project experience first in interviews and examine basic knowledge. Then let the interviewees talk about their workflow after receiving a requirement, and then combine a few business problems to roughly understand the person&#x27;s true level and whether they have system design capabilities. Whether a requirement can be entrusted to him with confidence, whether he considers the problem comprehensively, whether he is responsible and reliable. Although most people are crud, writing code is different from writing maintainable engineering. What is the difficulty of most business code now? The important thing is the attitude towards a requirement, whether he has his own ideas, and don&#x27;t dig pits for future generations.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@yuanyao 我面试一般会先看项目经历, 考察基础知识. 再让面试者说说拿到一个需求后他的工作流程是怎么样的, 再结合几个业务上的问题, 大概就能了解这个人的真实水平 以及他有没有系统设计能力. 一个需求能不能放心的交给他,考虑问题是否全面, 是否有责任心, 靠不靠谱.虽然说大部分人都是 crud 但写代码跟写可维护的工程是不一样的. 现在大部分业务的代码有什么难度可言, 重要的是对待一个需求的态度是怎么样的, 有没有自己的想法, 别给后人挖坑.</details></li><li>Very low, it&#x27;s a basic skill.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>很低，基本功了</details></li><li>What&#x27;s the salary range? I can do it hahaha.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>薪资范围多少，我能做出来哈哈哈</details></li><li>Maybe they didn&#x27;t memorize this one.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>可能没背这个吧，</details></li><li>What qualities does the candidate have to be able to write it? If this quality is required for the position, it is reasonable.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>能写出来代表该候选人有什么素质，这个素质如果是岗位需要的就合理</details></li>
