## What is an illiterate programmer?

Companies focus on efficiency, only look at the results, and don't care whether your code is hand-coded or AI-generated. Many companies are now laying off a large number of employees, requiring employees to use AI, and those who cannot use AI will be optimized.

As programmers in the information industry, they should not regard "hand-coding" as advanced and AI as low-level. If you can't even use basic tools, what are you talking about advanced?

So, **what is an illiterate programmer? It is precisely a programmer who cannot use AI.**

Finally, I want to say that AI will not only not create illiterate programmers, but will instead raise the overall level of programmers.</p>

## 什么是文盲程序员？

企业注重的是效率，只看结果，而不在乎你的代码是手搓的还是 AI 生成的。现在很多企业大量裁员，要求员工必须使用 AI ，不会用 AI 的就会被优化。

而作为信息行业的程序员，更不应该视“手搓”为高级，AI 为低级。你连基础的工具都不会用，还谈什么高级？

所以，**什么是文盲程序员？恰恰是不会用 AI 的程序员。**

最后我想说，AI 不仅不会造就文盲程序员，反而会整体拉高程序员的水平。</p>

                <li>I think a very important skill for programmers is to Get Your Hands Dirty, especially when debugging. For simple, mechanical tasks, using AI is very worthwhile, after all, it is a direct increase in productivity. But the problem that comes with it is: if there is a bug in the program, can you still fix it? I have seen many immature newbies desperately throw their vague compilation, running, and environmental errors to AI, and AI can only give equally vague and unhelpful answers. After all, Garbage in, garbage out, if the user does not provide information that can solve the problem, AI can not break through the limit of information theory no matter how powerful it is. Obtaining this information requires a lot of logical analysis and underlying interaction, from checking the environment to tracking system calls, registers, and decompiling assembly, simplifying code to create minimal reproduction, collecting information from the real environment and grasping the core problem. It is difficult to say that AI currently has such capabilities. Moreover, my assertion is that even if AI has developed to the point of having such capabilities, it will still require human assistance and guarantees to complete the coding work before human mathematical capabilities can fully understand this chaotic system. The current so-called "AI controls development" is no different from driving blindfolded: there is no problem in driving one or two kilometers, but when something goes wrong, you will not know how you died.<br>我觉得程序员很重要的能力是 Get Your Hands Dirty ，尤其是在 debug 的时候。对于简单的、机械化的工作，用 AI 完成我觉得是非常值得的，毕竟是直接的生产力提升。但与之而来的问题是：程序出 bug 后，你还会修吗？我见过很多不成熟的新人绝望地把自己语焉不详的编译、运行、环境报错丢给 AI ，AI 只能给出同样模糊、没有任何帮助的回答。毕竟 Garbage in, garbage out ，如果用户根本没有给出能解决问题的信息，AI 再强大也不可能突破信息论的上限。而获得这些信息，需要大量逻辑分析和底层交互，从检查环境到跟踪 system call 、寄存器和反编译汇编，简化代码来创造最小复现，从真实环境中收集信息并抓住核心问题，这样的能力目前 AI 很难说有。而且我的断言是：即使 AI 已经发展到拥有这样的能力，在人类的数学能力能完全理解这一混沌系统之前，也仍然需要人类辅助和保证来完成编码工作。现在所谓的「 AI 掌管开发」和蒙眼开车没什么区别：开个一两公里没什么问题，但出事的时候一定不知道自己怎么死了。</li><li>I thought of a meme from my school days: When can you copy homework? 1. When you encounter a question you know, you can copy homework to save time. 2. When you encounter a question you don't know, you can copy homework to learn the ideas. So you can copy whether you know it or not. But the purpose of copying homework is not to copy, but to master knowledge, test-taking skills, develop a sense of questions, and get high scores. If you only deal with daily inspections and copy blindly, you may not know what you are copying after a few chapters. The article reflects a similar problem. We are now using AI programming with great success. There is a prerequisite that is intentionally or unintentionally ignored, that is, everyone has more or less learned programming without AI, and you have some foundation when you copy AI things. If you rely too much on AI, it's like just copying the answers without looking at the process, and after a long time, you won't understand the process. Wouldn't that be illiterate?<br>我想到上学时候的一个梗：什么时候可以抄作业?1. 遇到你会的题目，可以抄作业，节省时间2. 遇到你不会的题目，可以抄作业，学习思路。所以遇到会与不会的，都可以抄。但抄作业不是目的，掌握知识，应试技巧，锻炼题感，拿到高分，这才是目的。而如果只应付每天的检查，盲目的抄写，几个章节后你很可能就不知道你在抄什么了。文章反映的也是类似的问题。我们现在用 AI 编程风生水起，有一个前提被有意无意的忽略了，就是大家多多少少在没有 AI 的时候，学习过编程，有些底子，你去抄 AI 的东西，有底。倘若过于依赖 AI ，就好像只抄答案不看过程，那久而久之，也就看不懂过程了。不就文盲了么。</li><li>Funny, do you really think no one knows AI? If you can't learn to drive, can't you take a car? Some people really regard AI programming as a technical barrier. Maybe some people will jump out and talk about the challenges of AI programming, but please don't mention low-level skills such as how to use prompts to describe requirements. The challenge of AI programming is left to the top programmers to solve. After solving, the bottom programmers just need to lie down and open their mouths. Thinking that using AI is a head start, but sweating profusely to change the prompts, it is hard to imagine which level you will be on in the future.<br>搞笑呢，真以为谁不会 AI ？开车你学不会，坐车你还不会？有些人还真把 AI 编程当成技术壁垒了。可能等下有些人会跳出来说什么 AI 编程的挑战性，拜托你千万别提怎么用提示词描述需求之类的低级技巧了。AI 编程的挑战性是留给最顶层的程序员去解决的。解决之后，底层的程序员只要躺着张嘴接就行了。以为自己用 AI 是在抢跑，结果改提示词改的满头大汗的，难以想象将来你会在第几层。</li><li>I saw a point of view a few days ago that programmers spend 10:1 time reading and programming. AI removes the first 10 of the programmer, and the latter 1 becomes meaningless. To put it bluntly, humans lack the ability and motivation to read, and further lack the ability to think deeply. From this point of view, it is indeed reducing intelligence, and it is no exaggeration to say that it is an illiterate programmer. Imagine a scenario where you usually use AI to write a bunch of code, and the customer has a problem, and you have to fix it now. Are you going to say that this code was written by AI, I need to ask AI for help, I have to turn on AI to fix the bug, and the customer says that my computer cannot connect to the Internet, are you dumbfounded? For another example, I used to write a video player and needed to read the FFmpeg source code on GitHub. Now I don't need it. You don't need to read any source code, and AI will write it directly for you, and it's much better than you write.<br>前几天看过一个观点，是说程序员阅读和编程的时间是 10：1 ，AI 把程序员的前面的 10 拿掉了，后面的 1 就变得没有多大意义了，说白了，人类缺乏了阅读能力和动力，进一步必然是缺乏深度思考的能力，从这种观点来说，的确是在降智，说文盲程序员不为过，试想一个场景，你平时用 AI 写了一堆代码，客户那儿出了问题，要你去现在修复，你难道说，这代码是 AI 写的，我要求助 AI ，必须开着 AI 修 bug ，客户说我电脑无法联网，你是不是傻眼了，再举一个例子，我以前要写个视频播放器，需要去 GitHub 阅读 FFmpeg 源码，现在不用了，你不用阅读任何源码，AI 就直接给你写出来了，而且远比你写的好。</li><li>As long as there is one that can run<br>反正有一个能跑就行</li><li>This claim should be used to increase your asking price. Everything else is wrong. eg I know xxx tool, so please pay more to hire me ✅ eg I know xxx tool, so this job becomes relatively easy, so the boss sees that I have xxx tool, so it can be easier / more productive / more cost-effective, the boss has more reasons to give me low wages: aren't you easier? ❎eg I know xxx tool, so I can squeeze out people who don't know xxx tool ❎eg I know xxx tool, my output is greater, so I have to increase my salary ✅eg I know xxx tool, I squeezed out people who don't know xx tool, I squeezed out people who don't dare to use xxx tool, and then I want less money, doubling my employment opportunities ❎<br>应该用这个 claim 来提高自己的要价能力才对 其它一切都是错的。eg我会 xxx 工具，所以雇我工作请多付钱 ✅ eg我会 xxx 工具，所以这份工作变得相对容易了，所以老板看我既然有 xxx 工具了 能更轻松了 / 更出活儿了 / 更有性价比了，老板更有理由给我低工资了：你不是更轻松了吗？ ❎eg我会 xxx 工具，所以我能把不会 xxx 工具的人挤走 ❎eg我会 xxx 工具，我的产量更大了，所以我得涨工资 ✅eg我会 xxx 工具，我把不会用 xx 工具的人挤走了，我把不敢用 xxx 工具的人挤走了，然后我反而要更少的钱了，加倍增加我的受雇佣机会 ❎</li><li>Why are there programming languages? To put it bluntly, it is to lower the threshold for communication between people and computers. Now that there is AI, the threshold is greatly reduced. Therefore, programmers who cannot program with AI are like programmers who have not yet started with programming languages.<br>为什么会有编程语言？说白了就是降低人和计算机沟通的门槛，现在有了 AI ，更是大大降低了这个门槛，所以，不会 AI 编程的程序员就像曾经编程语言还没入门的程序员一样。</li><li>@Nosub #14 Local models are also developing rapidly. Next year, 7B may be equivalent to the current 671B. It is completely okay to use AI to program offline. The ceiling of AI efficiency is people. Do you know how terrifying human efficiency is? AlphaGo played Go with Lee Sedol. AlphaGo spent $20,000 on electricity, and Lee Sedol only used 2 steamed buns.<br>@Nosub #14 本地模型也在飞速发展，明年 7B 可能就相当于现在 671B 了，离线用 AI 编程完全没问题，AI 效率的天花板是人，你知道人的效率有多恐怖吗，阿尔法狗跟李世石下一盘围棋，阿尔法狗用了 2 万美金的电费，李世石只用了 2 个馒头</li><li>I hope AI can eliminate some people who make me write this code ```javascript if( resp.code !== '200' && resp.code !==200) { throw new Error(resp.msg) }```<br>希望 ai 能取缔掉一些 让我写出```javascriptif( resp.code !== '200' && resp.code !==200) {  throw new Error(resp.msg)  }```这段代码的人</li><li>As long as it can run, it would be best if one day you could make requests at will and AI would help implement them.<br>能跑就行，最好有一天可以随意提需求，AI 帮忙实现就好了</li><li>I am currently trying to program for AI. The actual result is that after AI finishes writing, I still have to look at it again, run it, and adjust it. Illiterate people probably can't understand it, and complex projects still require deep human participation.<br>目前在尝试面向 ai 编程，实际结果是，ai 写完了自己肯定还要看一遍，跑一跑，调一调。文盲恐怕看都看不懂，复杂项目还是得人深度参与。</li><li>The illiterate programmer I understand is someone who can brag, but can't write code. Correspondingly, it can be understood as being able to talk but not write, just like some customers who understand names like html, js, database, and arrays, but they just can't write code and can only ask you to fix it. With this level, even if you throw the source code to him, he may not be able to run it.<br>我理解的文盲程序员是 ，会崔牛，但是不会编写。 对应理解为  会说不会写就好比总有些客户，什么 html  js 数据库  数组   这些名称他懂，但是他就是不会写，只能找你来搞定。就这水平把源码丢给他也不见得能运行起来。</li><li>Looking back on the history of the human industrial revolution, did each technological innovation eliminate the previous technical workers? Then no, technological innovation has brought various technical tools, which has greatly improved people's work efficiency, and the development of productivity has promoted changes in production relations. The changes in production relations have affected occupations. The experience requirements for using new tools for occupations will be further improved, and the occupational threshold will be further lowered. For example, before the advent of computers, engineering drawing/model building was basically done by hand. After the advent of computers, computers began to dominate drawing and model building, replacing traditional labor-intensive manual drawing. Prominent tools such as CAD began to spread the concept of computer-aided human design software. The requirements for occupations have also shifted from manual drawing experience to computer-aided drawing experience, but have the experienced manual draftsmen with rich experience been immediately eliminated? Obviously not, because tools only assist humans in improving production efficiency, but professional experience cannot be fully understood and mastered by novices in a short period of time, because the ultimate decision is made by humans, not assistive tools. Therefore, AI will improve production efficiency and lower some technical thresholds, but there will be no illiterate programmers. If there are illiterate "programmers", then they are definitely not programmers. It is just that AI has lowered the occupational threshold, allowing other professions to complete certain programming tasks.<br>翻开人类工业革命史，每次技术革新，都把之前的技术工人淘汰了吗？然后并不是，技术革新带来了各类技术工具，使人的工作效率得到了大幅提升，生产力的发展进而促使了生产关系的变化，生产关系的变化又对职业产生了影响，职业会对新工具使用经验要求会进一步提升，同时职业门槛会进一步降低。举个例子：在计算机出来之前，工程制图/模型搭建基本都是手撸的，计算机出来之后，开始由计算机主导制图和模型搭建，代替了传统耗费工时手工制图，突出的工具例如 CAD 等等，以计算机辅助人类设计软件理念开始传播，对职业的要求也由手工制图经验向计算机制图经验开始转变，但之前丰富经验的手工制图师都立马淘汰了吗？很明显没有，因为工具只是辅助人类提升生产效率，但是职业化经验，并不是短时间新手就能完全理解和掌握的，因为最终做决策的是人，而不是辅助工具。因此 AI 会提高生产效率，会降低部分技术门槛，但不会存在什么文盲程序员，如果有文盲"程序员"，那绝对不是程序员，只是 AI 降低了职业门槛，使其他职业可以完成某些的编程任务罢了。</li><li>Opening a book is beneficial, opening an AI is even more beneficial.<br>开卷有益 开卷 AI 更有益</li><li>The preconditions for your discussion are different. If the economic environment is good and companies have a lot of demand, they will recruit a lot of "illiterate programmers." Conversely, if the economic environment is poor and companies have less demand, they will fire programmers. "Illiterate people" will definitely bear the brunt. Similar things have already happened. You can replace AI with training courses. Ten years ago, programmers in training courses had high-paying jobs, but now programmers in training courses have difficulty finding jobs.<br>你俩讨论的前提条件就不一样，如果经济环境好企业有大量需求，那就会招大量的”文盲程序员“，相反经济环境差企业需求少，那么就会开除程序员，”文盲“肯定首当其冲。类似的事情早就已经发生过了，你把 AI 换成培训班就行了，十年前培训班程序员高薪就业，现在培训班程序员就业困难。</li><li>AI just gives you a 24-hour assistant and you have to do everything yourself, what does that mean?
