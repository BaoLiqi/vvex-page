## What is an illiterate programmer?

Companies focus on efficiency and only look at the results, regardless of whether your code is hand-written or AI-generated. Many companies are now laying off large numbers of employees, requiring employees to use AI. Those who cannot use AI will be optimized.

As programmers in the information industry, they should not regard &quot;hand-writing&quot; as advanced and AI as low-level. If you can&#x27;t even use basic tools, what are you talking about being advanced?

So, **what is an illiterate programmer? It is precisely the programmer who cannot use AI.**

Finally, I want to say that AI will not only not create illiterate programmers, but will instead raise the overall level of programmers.</p>

## 什么是文盲程序员？

企业注重的是效率，只看结果，而不在乎你的代码是手搓的还是 AI 生成的。现在很多企业大量裁员，要求员工必须使用 AI ，不会用 AI 的就会被优化。

而作为信息行业的程序员，更不应该视“手搓”为高级，AI 为低级。你连基础的工具都不会用，还谈什么高级？

所以，**什么是文盲程序员？恰恰是不会用 AI 的程序员。**

最后我想说，AI 不仅不会造就文盲程序员，反而会整体拉高程序员的水平。</p>

                <li>I think a very important ability for programmers is to Get Your Hands Dirty, especially when debugging. For simple, mechanical tasks, I think it&#x27;s very worthwhile to use AI to complete them, after all, it&#x27;s a direct increase in productivity. But the problem that comes with it is: if the program has a bug, can you still fix it? I have seen many immature newcomers desperately throw their vague compilation, execution, and environment errors to AI, and AI can only give equally vague and unhelpful answers. After all, Garbage in, garbage out. If the user does not provide information that can solve the problem, even the most powerful AI cannot break through the limits of information theory. Obtaining this information requires a lot of logical analysis and underlying interaction, from checking the environment to tracking system calls, registers, and disassembling assembly, simplifying code to create minimal reproduction, collecting information from the real environment and grasping the core problem. It is hard to say that AI currently has this ability. Moreover, my assertion is that even if AI has developed to have this ability, human assistance and guarantees will still be needed to complete the coding work before human mathematical abilities can fully understand this chaotic system. The so-called &quot;AI in charge of development&quot; is no different from driving blindfolded: there is no problem driving a kilometer or two, but when something goes wrong, you will definitely not know how you died.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我觉得程序员很重要的能力是 Get Your Hands Dirty ，尤其是在 debug 的时候。对于简单的、机械化的工作，用 AI 完成我觉得是非常值得的，毕竟是直接的生产力提升。但与之而来的问题是：程序出 bug 后，你还会修吗？我见过很多不成熟的新人绝望地把自己语焉不详的编译、运行、环境报错丢给 AI ，AI 只能给出同样模糊、没有任何帮助的回答。毕竟 Garbage in, garbage out ，如果用户根本没有给出能解决问题的信息，AI 再强大也不可能突破信息论的上限。而获得这些信息，需要大量逻辑分析和底层交互，从检查环境到跟踪 system call 、寄存器和反编译汇编，简化代码来创造最小复现，从真实环境中收集信息并抓住核心问题，这样的能力目前 AI 很难说有。而且我的断言是：即使 AI 已经发展到拥有这样的能力，在人类的数学能力能完全理解这一混沌系统之前，也仍然需要人类辅助和保证来完成编码工作。现在所谓的「 AI 掌管开发」和蒙眼开车没什么区别：开个一两公里没什么问题，但出事的时候一定不知道自己怎么死了。</details></li><li>I thought of a meme from when I was in school: When can you copy homework? 1. If you encounter a problem you know, you can copy homework to save time. 2. If you encounter a problem you don&#x27;t know, you can copy homework to learn the ideas. So, you can copy whether you know it or not. But copying homework is not the goal. The goal is to master knowledge, test-taking skills, develop a feeling for the problem, and get high scores. But if you only cope with daily inspections and copy blindly, after a few chapters, you may not know what you are copying. The article reflects a similar problem. We are now using AI programming successfully, but one premise is intentionally or unintentionally ignored: more or less everyone learned programming without AI and has some foundation. You have a foundation when you copy from AI. If you rely too much on AI, it&#x27;s like just copying the answer without looking at the process. After a long time, you won&#x27;t be able to understand the process anymore, and won&#x27;t you be illiterate?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我想到上学时候的一个梗：什么时候可以抄作业?1. 遇到你会的题目，可以抄作业，节省时间2. 遇到你不会的题目，可以抄作业，学习思路。所以遇到会与不会的，都可以抄。但抄作业不是目的，掌握知识，应试技巧，锻炼题感，拿到高分，这才是目的。而如果只应付每天的检查，盲目的抄写，几个章节后你很可能就不知道你在抄什么了。文章反映的也是类似的问题。我们现在用 AI 编程风生水起，有一个前提被有意无意的忽略了，就是大家多多少少在没有 AI 的时候，学习过编程，有些底子，你去抄 AI 的东西，有底。倘若过于依赖 AI ，就好像只抄答案不看过程，那久而久之，也就看不懂过程了。不就文盲了么。</details></li><li>Funny, does anyone really think no one knows AI? If you can&#x27;t learn to drive, can&#x27;t you ride? Some people really regard AI programming as a technical barrier. Maybe some people will jump out later and say something about the challenges of AI programming, but please don&#x27;t mention low-level skills such as how to use prompts to describe requirements. The challenge of AI programming is left to the top programmers to solve. After the solution， the bottom programmers just need to lie down and open their mouths to receive it. Thinking that they are using AI to get ahead, but they are sweating profusely changing prompts. It&#x27;s hard to imagine what level you will be at in the future.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>搞笑呢，真以为谁不会 AI ？开车你学不会，坐车你还不会？有些人还真把 AI 编程当成技术壁垒了。可能等下有些人会跳出来说什么 AI 编程的挑战性，拜托你千万别提怎么用提示词描述需求之类的低级技巧了。AI 编程的挑战性是留给最顶层的程序员去解决的。解决之后，底层的程序员只要躺着张嘴接就行了。以为自己用 AI 是在抢跑，结果改提示词改的满头大汗的，难以想象将来你会在第几层。</details></li><li>A few days ago, I saw a point of view that the time programmers spend reading and programming is 10:1. AI removes the first 10 of the programmer, and the latter 1 becomes less meaningful. To put it bluntly, humans lack reading ability and motivation, and further they will inevitably lack the ability to think deeply. From this point of view, it is indeed reducing intelligence, and it is no exaggeration to say that they are illiterate programmers. Imagine a scenario where you usually use AI to write a lot of code, and there is a problem at the customer&#x27;s place, and you are asked to fix it now. Are you going to say that the code was written by AI, I need to ask AI for help, I have to turn on AI to fix the bug , if the customer says my computer can&#x27;t connect to the Internet, are you dumbfounded? For another example, I used to write a video player and needed to read the FFmpeg source code on GitHub, but now I don&#x27;t need to. You don&#x27;t need to read any source code, AI can write it directly for you, and it&#x27;s much better than you write.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>前几天看过一个观点，是说程序员阅读和编程的时间是 10：1 ，AI 把程序员的前面的 10 拿掉了，后面的 1 就变得没有多大意义了，说白了，人类缺乏了阅读能力和动力，进一步必然是缺乏深度思考的能力，从这种观点来说，的确是在降智，说文盲程序员不为过，试想一个场景，你平时用 AI 写了一堆代码，客户那儿出了问题，要你去现在修复，你难道说，这代码是 AI 写的，我要求助 AI ，必须开着 AI 修 bug ，客户说我电脑无法联网，你是不是傻眼了，再举一个例子，我以前要写个视频播放器，需要去 GitHub 阅读 FFmpeg 源码，现在不用了，你不用阅读任何源码，AI 就直接给你写出来了，而且远比你写的好。</details></li><li>As long as one can run<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>反正有一个能跑就行</details></li><li>This claim should be used to increase your asking price.

To put it bluntly, it is to lower the barrier for people to communicate with computers. Now that there is AI, this barrier has been greatly lowered. Therefore, programmers who don&#x27;t know AI programming are like programmers who haven&#x27;t gotten started with programming languages before.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>为什么会有编程语言？说白了就是降低人和计算机沟通的门槛，现在有了 AI ，更是大大降低了这个门槛，所以，不会 AI 编程的程序员就像曾经编程语言还没入门的程序员一样。</details></li><li>@Nosub #14 Local models are also developing rapidly.

The corresponding understanding is that being able to talk but not write is like some customers who understand the names of things like html, js, databases, arrays, but they just can&#x27;t write it themselves and can only ask you to fix it.

But no, technological innovations have brought various technical tools, which have greatly improved people&#x27;s work efficiency. The development of productivity has promoted changes in production relations, and changes in production relations have affected occupations. Occupations will further increase the requirements for the use of new tools, and at the same time lower the threshold for occupations. For example: Before the advent of computers, engineering drawing/model building was basically done by hand. After the advent of computers, computer-led drawing and model building began, replacing the traditional time-consuming manual drawing. Prominent tools such as CAD, etc., began to promote the concept of computer-aided human design software. The requirements for the profession also began to shift from manual drafting experience to computer-aided drafting experience, but were the experienced manual drafters immediately eliminated? Obviously not, because tools only assist humans in improving production efficiency, but professional experience is not something that novices can fully understand and master in a short period of time, because the final decision maker is a person, not an assisted tool. Therefore, AI will improve production efficiency and lower some technical thresholds, but there will be no illiterate programmers. If there are illiterate &quot;programmers&quot;, then they are definitely not programmers. It is just that AI has lowered the threshold for occupations, allowing other occupations to complete certain programming tasks.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>翻开人类工业革命史，每次技术革新，都把之前的技术工人淘汰了吗？然后并不是，技术革新带来了各类技术工具，使人的工作效率得到了大幅提升，生产力的发展进而促使了生产关系的变化，生产关系的变化又对职业产生了影响，职业会对新工具使用经验要求会进一步提升，同时职业门槛会进一步降低。举个例子：在计算机出来之前，工程制图/模型搭建基本都是手撸的，计算机出来之后，开始由计算机主导制图和模型搭建，代替了传统耗费工时手工制图，突出的工具例如 CAD 等等，以计算机辅助人类设计软件理念开始传播，对职业的要求也由手工制图经验向计算机制图经验开始转变，但之前丰富经验的手工制图师都立马淘汰了吗？很明显没有，因为工具只是辅助人类提升生产效率，但是职业化经验，并不是短时间新手就能完全理解和掌握的，因为最终做决策的是人，而不是辅助工具。因此 AI 会提高生产效率，会降低部分技术门槛，但不会存在什么文盲程序员，如果有文盲&quot;程序员&quot;，那绝对不是程序员，只是 AI 降低了职业门槛，使其他职业可以完成某些的编程任务罢了。</details></li><li>Reading is beneficial, and reading AI is even more beneficial.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>开卷有益 开卷 AI 更有益</details></li><li>The preconditions for your discussion are different.
