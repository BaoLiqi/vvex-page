## What is an illiterate programmer?

Companies focus on efficiency and only look at results, regardless of whether your code is hand-coded or AI-generated. Many companies are now laying off large numbers of employees and require employees to use AI. Those who don&#x27;t know how to use AI will be optimized.

As programmers in the information industry, they should not regard &quot;hand-coding&quot; as advanced and AI as low-level. If you can&#x27;t use basic tools, what are you talking about being advanced?

So, **what is an illiterate programmer? It is precisely programmers who don&#x27;t know how to use AI.**

Finally, I would like to say that AI will not only create illiterate programmers, but will also raise the overall level of programmers.</p>

                <p>論劍智械扶搖，文盲碼農現世乎？

(詳見：https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/-m-ITkVRu2ShxkxELIBDKA)

## 何谓道心文盲之碼農？

宗門重效率，唯果是瞻，豈論手書或智械造化。今裁員若洪，敕令弟子運智械。不諳智械者，黜之。

然處於靈訊界，碼農不應以手書為尊，智械為卑。若連靈器皆不能御，何談大道？

故，**何謂道心文盲之碼農？不善智械之碼農也。**

噫吁戲，智械非但不能造就文盲碼農，反可拔升整體修為。</p>

                <li>I think a very important ability for programmers is Get Your Hands Dirty, especially when debugging. For simple, mechanized work, I think it&#x27;s very worthwhile to use AI, after all, it directly improves productivity. But the problem that comes with it is: if there is a bug in the program, can you still fix it? I have seen many immature newcomers desperately throw their vague compilation, running, and environment errors to AI. AI can only give similarly vague and unhelpful answers. After all, Garbage in, garbage out, if the user doesn&#x27;t provide information that can solve the problem, AI can&#x27;t break the upper limit of information theory no matter how powerful it is. Getting this information requires a lot of logical analysis and low-level interaction: from checking the environment to tracking system calls, registers, and decompiling assembly, simplifying code to create minimal reproduction, and collecting information from the real environment and grasping the core issues. It is difficult to say that AI currently has this ability. Moreover, my assertion is: even if AI has developed to the point where it possesses this ability, it will still require human assistance and guarantee to complete the coding work before human mathematical abilities can fully understand this chaotic system. The so-called &quot;AI managing development&quot; is no different from driving with your eyes closed: there is no problem driving one or two kilometers, but you will definitely not know how you died when something goes wrong.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>鄙人以为，碼農之要，力親而為，尤以除蟲為甚。若夫簡工、械工，用智械乃正道，蓋其增產是也。然隨之而來者，若程式有蟲，君能除之乎？吾見稚嫩之新修，絕望掷其語焉不詳之編譯、運行、環境报错於智械。智械亦唯能給以同樣模糊、無助之答覆。蓋垃圾入，垃圾出也，若用戶不供能解問題之靈訊，智械縱有神通，亦難逃信息論之樊籠。欲得此靈訊，需邏輯分析與底靈互動：自檢驗環境至追踪系統調用、寄存器、反編譯彙編，簡化代碼以創最小復現，自真實環境蒐集靈訊而執其要害。如是神通，今之智械難言具備。吾更斷言，縱智械已具備如是神通，然在凡人算力堪透此混沌系統前，仍需人助與保，方能竟編碼之功。所謂「智械掌开发」猶如盲人摸象也：行一二里無恙，然遇險必不知所終。</details></li><li>I thought of a joke from when I was in school: when can you copy homework? 1. You can copy homework when you encounter a question you know, saving time. 2. You can copy homework when you encounter a question you don&#x27;t know, learning ideas. So you can copy whether you know the answer or not. But copying homework is not the goal. Mastering knowledge, exam skills, developing a feel for questions, and getting high scores are the goals. If you only cope with daily inspections and copy blindly, after a few chapters you may not know what you are copying. The article reflects a similar problem. We are now using AI to program vigorously, but one premise is intentionally or unintentionally ignored, that is, everyone has learned to program more or less without AI, and has some foundation. If you copy AI&#x27;s things, you have a foundation. If you rely too much on AI, it&#x27;s like only copying the answers without looking at the process, and after a long time, you won&#x27;t be able to understand the process. Wouldn&#x27;t that be illiterate?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>憶昔求學，嘗有戲言：何時可抄書？一曰：遇君所曉，可抄書，省時也。二曰：遇君所昧，可抄書，學思路也。故無論知否，皆可抄。然抄書非目的，明知識、習應試、養題感、得高分，是為目標。若僅應付日課，盲目抄寫，數章之後，或已不知所抄為何。此文映照者，亦類於此。吾等今以智械编程風生水起，然有一前提，或有意或無意，為人所輕忽，即諸君多或少，於無智械之時，既曾學编程，略有根基。君抄智械之物，賴此根基。若過於倚賴智械，猶如僅抄答案而不顧過程，久而久之，則難窺其奧。豈非文盲乎？</details></li><li>Funny, do you really think no one knows AI? If you can&#x27;t learn to drive, can&#x27;t you at least ride in the car? Some people really treat AI programming as a technical barrier. Maybe some people will jump out and say something about the challenges of AI programming, please don&#x27;t mention low-level skills like how to use prompts to describe requirements. The challenges of AI programming are left for the top programmers to solve. After solving it, the bottom programmers just have to lie down and open their mouths to receive it. Thinking that you are running ahead by using AI, but in the end you are sweating profusely trying to change prompts. It&#x27;s hard to imagine what level you will be at in the future.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>可笑也，竟謂無人識智械乎？駕車不能習，豈不能乘車乎？或有以智械编程為技術壁壘者。或有人跳出，言智械编程之艱，然勿提如何以提示詞描述需求之卑微技巧。智械编程之艱，乃留與頂尖碼農解之。解之既成，底層碼農但需伏榻張口受之。自以為用智械乃抢跑，結果改提示詞改的满头大汗，難以想像將來汝位居何層。</details></li><li>I saw a point of view a few days ago that the ratio of programmers&#x27; reading time to programming time is 10:1. AI removes the first 10, and the last 1 becomes meaningless. To put it bluntly, humans lack reading ability and motivation, and further inevitably lack the ability to think deeply. From this point of view, it is indeed lowering intelligence, and it is not an exaggeration to say that it is an illiterate programmer. Imagine a scene, you usually use AI to write a bunch of code, and there is a problem at the customer&#x27;s place, and you have to go to fix it now. You don&#x27;t mean to say that this code was written by AI, and I need to ask AI for help and must fix the bug with AI turned on. The customer says my computer cannot connect to the Internet, are you stupid? To give another example, I used to write a video player and needed to read the FFmpeg source code on GitHub. Now I don&#x27;t need to read any source code. AI can write it directly for you, and it is far better than what you write.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>數日前讀一觀點，謂碼農之閱讀時與编程時之比為十比一。智械夺前十，後一遂淪無義。直言之，人乏讀力與動力，進而必乏深度思辨之力。由是觀之，实乃降智，謂文盲碼農未為過也。設一場景，君平日用智械書代码一堆，客戶處有恙，需君即刻修之。君豈言，此代码乃智械所書，吾需求助智械，必開智械方可除蟲。客戶曰，吾電算機不能聯網，君豈可張口結舌？再舉一例，吾昔欲書一視頻播放器，需讀GitHub上之FFmpeg源碼。今則無需讀任何源碼。智械可直給君書之，且遠勝君所書。</details></li><li>It&#x27;s enough to have something that can run<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>能跑就行</details></li><li>This claim should be used to increase your asking price.

Not really. Technological innovation has brought various technical tools, which have greatly improved people&#x27;s work efficiency. The development of productivity has in turn promoted the changes in production relations, and the changes in production relations have had an impact on occupations. The experience requirements for the use of new tools in occupations will be further improved, and at the same time, the occupational threshold will be further reduced. For example, before computers came out, engineering drawing/model building was basically done by hand. After computers came out, computers began to dominate drawing and model building, replacing the traditional time-consuming manual drawing. Prominent tools such as CAD began to spread the concept of computer-aided human design software. The occupational requirements have also begun to shift from manual drawing experience to computer drawing experience. But did all the experienced manual drafters immediately get eliminated? Obviously not, because tools are only to assist humans in improving production efficiency, but professional experience cannot be fully understood and mastered by novices in a short period of time, because the person who ultimately makes the decision is the person, not the auxiliary tool. Therefore, AI will improve production efficiency, and will reduce some technical thresholds, but there will be no illiterate programmers. If there are illiterate &quot;programmers&quot;, then they are definitely not programmers. It is just that AI has lowered the occupational threshold, allowing other occupations to complete certain programming tasks.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>稽諸凡塵工業變革史，每次技術革新，皆汰前代之技工乎？不然也。技術革新，帶來諸般靈器，使人功大進。生產力之發展，進而催生生產關係之變，生產關係之變，又對職業產生影響。職業對新器之用，求益精湛，職業之門檻，隨之降低。譬如，在電算機出世之前，工程製圖/模型搭建，基本皆由手造。電算機出世之後，始由電算機主導製圖與模型搭建，取代傳統耗時之手造。CAD等突出的靈器，開始傳播電算機輔助人類設計軟體之理念。職業之要求，亦由手工製圖之經驗，向計算機制圖之經驗轉變。然早年經驗豐富之手工製圖師，皆立即淘汰乎？顯然不然，蓋靈器僅輔助人類提升生產效率，而職業化之經驗，非短時間新手所能完全理解及掌握，蓋最終決策者，乃人也，非輔助靈器。是以，AI將提升生產效率，將降低技術門檻，然文盲碼農何有？若有文盲「碼農」，則斷非碼農也，乃智械降低職業門檻，令其他職業勉可竟某些编程任务。</details></li><li>Opening a book is beneficial, opening an AI is even more beneficial<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>開卷有益 開卷 AI 更有益</details></li><li>The prerequisites for your discussions are different.
