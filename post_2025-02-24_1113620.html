                <li>@laikick Too good to laugh at, right?<br>@laikick 太好孝了吧</li><li>They are now judging whether someone is Chinese by their working hours in China. There are also alternatives now. They never thought of using technology to help all mankind, and their vision is far from that of Musk.<br>已经通过国内的工作时间来判断是否是中国人在使用了现在平替也有了，他们从来没想过用科技来帮助全人类和马斯克的格局差的远了</li><li>@hallostr Spreading rumors again?<br>@hallostr 又来造谣了？</li><li>@daishuge No source, no OpenAI document, no examples. Only one sentence is true. Even if you think about it, how many ChatGPT users are there on this forum? Assuming one-tenth of them were banned because of Chinese working hours, how many threads would there be on the forum now? You don't even think, you just open your mouth and say it's true.<br>@daishuge 信源没有，openai 的文件没有，例子没有。就一句是真的。哪怕你想一想，这个论坛有多少 chatgpt 用户，假设他们中的十分之一因为中国人的工作时间被封号了，论坛现在会有多少个主题帖。想都不想，张嘴三个字，是真的。</li><li>@SmithJohn #19 No matter how you try to whitewash it, systemic discrimination against normal users from mainland China, severe dumbing down, and account bans can be confirmed by a large amount of user feedback. As for the most detailed risk control rules, almost no manufacturer will publish their detailed risk control rules. They are always reverse-summarized based on a large amount of feedback.<br>@SmithJohn #19 不管你去咋洗，针对来自中国大陆地区的正常用户的系统性歧视，严重的降智、封号是可以被大量的用户反馈所证实的。至于最详细的风控规则，几乎没有一个厂商会公布自己的详细的风控规则，向来都是大家根据大量的反馈进行逆向总结。</li><li>@SmithJohn So what's your point? Are you trying to say that OpenAI did not ban accounts based on Chinese working hours? But OpenAI's report proves this. Even though the report also stated that the banned accounts may be some politically related accounts, it does not change the objective fact that OpenAI banned accounts based on Chinese working hours. So how is #4 hallostr's statement a rumor? It's not that there's anything unreasonable about banning Chinese accounts. The reason for banning Chinese accounts only needs to bring out the US export control regulations. After all, No one is above the law~<br>@SmithJohn 所以你的观点是什么呢？你是想说明 OpenAI 没有根据中国的工作时间去封禁账号？但是 OpenAI 的报告则证明了这一点。即便报告中也说明了封禁的账号可能是一些政治相关的账号，但是这并不能改变 OpenAI 根据中国的工作时间封禁账号这一客观事实。所以 #4 hallostr 的观点又何来造谣之有呢？并不是说封禁中国账号的行为有什么不合理之处，封禁中国账号的理由只需要搬出来美国那一套出口管制法规即可。毕竟 No one is above the law~</li><li>Normally, the more people use this, the more money they make, but they would rather not earn this money and not let you use it, and they use all means to check and audit. If it is an ordinary application, even if there is a ban, it is estimated that it will be simply blocked. As for accessing and using it through other methods, they may not spend too much energy checking, after all, it can increase the number of users and income. But this CEO of this AI company really doesn't want people to use it from the bottom of his heart.<br>按正常来说这种用的人越多他们赚钱的也越多，但是他们确实宁愿不赚这个钱也不让你用，而且用尽方法去检查审核，如果是一个普通应用即便有禁令估计也就简单屏蔽一下，至于通过其他方法访问使用可能也不会过度去浪费精力检查，毕竟可以增加用户量和收入，但是这个 AI 确实是这个公司 CEO 发自内心的不想让用的。</li><li>@Jerry23333 First of all, there is no such thing as a normal user from mainland China. They explicitly stated that they do not provide any services to China. Thank you. As a customer, it is normal to be banned for violating the agreement.<br>@Jerry23333 首先 就没有来自中国大陆地区的正常用户这个说法 人家明确表示不给中国提供任何服务 谢谢. 你作为客户违反了协议进行封号很正常</li><li>They are no longer far ahead, you can try other products.<br>它家已经不是遥遥领先了，可以试下其他产品</li><li>Why still use this? Even if you pay, the effect is not as good as deepseek.<br>为啥还要用这个。 就算是交钱了效果也不如 deepseek 啊。</li><li>grok3 is good<br>grok3 不错</li><li>I was also banned and not refunded before, just called the API with a domestic IP. The customer service is like dead.<br>我之前也是封号都不给我退款的，就是国内 ip 调用了一下 api 。客服和死了一样</li><li>Violating the TOS and forcibly using it should have prepared you for being banned long ago.<br>违反 tos 强行使用应该早都做好被封号的准备了吧。</li><li>@Jerry23333 It was not originally intended for Chinese users. What's the problem? American laws do not allow you to use it.<br>@Jerry23333 本来就不是给你中国用户用的啊. 有什么问题? 美国法律都不允许你使用</li><li>@daishuge #11 Losing the argument, you block people and still mention it, do you really think you are something?<br>@daishuge #11 理亏 block 人还要提一嘴，真把你自己当成个东西</li><li>@daishuge I acquired OpenAI and will open source all the code next month, it's true, believe it or not.<br>@daishuge 我收购了 openai ，下个月开源全部代码，是真的，不信算了</li><li>@shewhen Can't you even understand Chinese? .... Take the seventh line of the screenshot sent by Telegram and go directly to the document to see what "political behavior" is. If you can't understand English, it doesn't matter, there is a Chinese company name on page 14 of the document, copy and paste it into translation software. If you still don't understand, you can find an AI to help you summarize it.<br>@shewhen 你这是连中文都看不懂吗。。。。你拿着这个 telegram 所发截图的第七行，直接去文档里面看看到底是什么“政治行为”。看不懂英文不要紧，文档第十四页有一个中文的公司名，复制粘贴到翻译软件里。如果还是看不懂可以找个 AI 帮你总结一下。</li><li>Isn't it good? Massively ban Chinese accounts, and then there's no choice but to choose domestic ones, recharge domestic manufacturers, and support domestic manufacturers. My suggestion is to ban harder.<br>不是挺好的吗？ 大量封禁中国账号 然后没办法 只有选择国内的 给国内的厂商充值 把国内的厂商养起来，我的建议是封狠一点</li><li>https://openai.com/global-affairs/disrupting-malicious-uses-of-ai<br>https://openai.com/global-affairs/disrupting-malicious-uses-of-ai</li><li>@szguan You are really funny. I paid for a whole year's PLUS subscription, how many dollars did it cost, it's not up to you to evaluate trivial matters. My criticism of OpenAI is also his fake open source real profit, humorous self-positioning, and ridiculous power struggle. Rather than the regional user policies that you have been talking about, you only care about whether you can use that little bit of broken conversation.<br>@szguan 你是真幽默，我付费订阅了一整年的 PLUS 花了多少刀，轮得到你来评价升米斗米。我批评 OpenAI 也是他的伪开源真盈利，幽默的自身定位，滑稽的权力斗争。而不是你们一直说来说去的地区性用户政策，只关心自己能不能用得上那点破对话。</li>
