Now there are alternatives. They never thought of using technology to help all mankind, and their pattern is far from Musk&#x27;s.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>竟以华夏作息断人种属，平替之物已现。其心胸狭隘，未曾念及科技普济众生，与马斯克之格局相去甚远。</details></li><li>@hallostr Spreading rumors again?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@hallostr 又欲蛊惑人心？</details></li><li>@daishuge No source, no OpenAI files, no examples. Only one sentence is true. Even if you think about it, how many ChatGPT users are there on this forum? Assuming that one-tenth of them were banned because of Chinese working hours, how many topic threads would there be on the forum now. Without even thinking, you open your mouth and say three words: It&#x27;s true.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@daishuge 信源皆无，openai文档亦不见，例证亦无。仅凭一语，便断言为真，岂不荒谬？纵观此坛，chatgpt之用者众矣，若十分之一因作息而被封禁，此地岂不早已沸反盈天？不经深思，妄言“为真”，实乃轻率。</details></li><li>@SmithJohn #19 No matter how you try to defend it, systematic discrimination against normal users from mainland China, serious cognitive decline, and account bans can be confirmed by a large number of user feedbacks. As for the most detailed risk control rules, almost no manufacturer will publish their detailed risk control rules. Everyone always summarizes them in reverse based on a large amount of feedback.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@SmithJohn #19 无论道友如何辩解，对华夏大陆正常用户的系统性歧视，降智封号之事，用户反馈已可证实。风控规则，厂商鲜有公开，皆由逆向推导而得。</details></li><li>@SmithJohn So what is your point? Are you trying to say that OpenAI did not ban accounts based on Chinese working hours? But OpenAI&#x27;s report proves this point. Even if the report also states that the banned accounts may be some politically related accounts, this does not change the objective fact that OpenAI banned accounts based on Chinese working hours. So where is the rumor from #4 hallostr? It&#x27;s not that there is anything unreasonable about banning Chinese accounts. The reason for banning Chinese accounts only needs to cite the US export control regulations. After all, No one is above the law~<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@SmithJohn 道友意欲何为？欲证OpenAI未曾以华夏作息封禁账号？然OpenAI之报告已然证实此事。纵使报告中亦有提及，封禁账号或涉政治相关事宜，然以华夏作息封禁账号，乃不争之实。#4 hallostr之言，何来谣言之说？封禁华夏账号之举，亦非全无道理，美国出口管制法规，足可为据。毕竟，天道昭昭，无人可凌驾其上。</details></li><li>Normally, the more people use it, the more money they make, but they really would rather not make this money and not let you use it, and use all methods to check and audit. If it is an ordinary application, even if there is a ban, it is estimated that it will be simply blocked. As for accessing and using it through other methods, it may not be too much to waste effort to check, after all, it can increase the number of users and income, but this AI indeed is the company CEO&#x27;s heartfelt unwillingness to let users use it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>常理而言，用者愈众，则其利愈丰。然其宁舍财帛，亦不允汝等用之，竭力审查。若寻常应用，纵有禁令，亦不过略作屏蔽。至于其他途径，或不费力审查，增用户，进财帛。唯此AI，其执掌者，实不愿予汝等用之。</details></li><li>@Jerry23333 First of all, there is no such thing as a normal user from mainland China. They clearly stated that they do not provide any services to China. Thank you. It is normal for you to violate the agreement and be banned.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Jerry23333 既已知其不予华夏提供服务，何来正常用户之说？阁下既违背协议，遭封禁亦为常事。</details></li><li>Its family is no longer far ahead, you can try other products<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此物已非遥遥领先，不如另寻他途。</details></li><li>Why do you still use this? Even if you pay, the effect is not as good as deepseek.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>何必执着于此？纵使付费，其效亦不如deepseek。</details></li><li>grok3 is good<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>grok3 甚妙</details></li><li>I was also banned before and they didn&#x27;t refund me, I just called the api with a domestic ip. The customer service was like dead.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾亦曾因国内IP调用API遭封禁，且不退款，客服如死尸。</details></li><li>You should have been prepared to be banned for forcibly using it in violation of tos.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>既违背协议，强行使用，早应预料此劫。</details></li><li>@Jerry23333 It&#x27;s not for you Chinese users anyway. What&#x27;s the problem? American law doesn&#x27;t allow you to use it<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Jerry23333 此物本非尔等华夏用户所用，有何疑义？美利坚律法不容也。</details></li><li>@daishuge #11 Losing the argument so block people, and have to mention it, really think of yourself as something<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@daishuge #11 论据不足便拉黑，竟还特意提一嘴，莫非自视甚高？</details></li><li>@daishuge I bought openai, and I&#x27;ll open source all the code next month, it&#x27;s true, don&#x27;t believe it<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@daishuge 吾已购得openai，下月将开源全部代码，此言为真，信与不信，由君自择。</details></li><li>@shewhen You can&#x27;t even understand Chinese... Look at the seventh line of the screenshot posted by Telegram and go directly to the document to see what exactly is &quot;political behavior&quot;. If you don&#x27;t understand English, it doesn&#x27;t matter. There is a Chinese company name on page 14 of the document. Copy and paste it into a translation software. If you still don&#x27;t understand, you can find an AI to help you summarize it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@shewhen 阁下莫非连中文都无法理解？请看telegram所发截图之第七行，细阅文档中何为“政治行为”。若不解英文，亦无妨，文档第十四页有华夏公司之名，复制粘贴至翻译之器中。若仍不明，可寻AI助尔总结。</details></li><li>Isn&#x27;t it great? A large number of Chinese accounts are banned, so there is no choice but to choose domestic ones and recharge the domestic manufacturers to support the domestic manufacturers. My suggestion is to ban them harder.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此非善事乎？大量封禁华夏账号，迫使其转投国内厂商，裨益国产，吾建议，封禁力度当更甚之。</details></li><li>https://openai.com/global-affairs/disrupting-malicious-uses-of-ai<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>https://openai.com/global-affairs/disrupting-malicious-uses-of-ai</details></li><li>@szguan You are really humorous. I paid for a whole year of PLUS. How much did you spend? It&#x27;s up to you to evaluate Shengmi Doumi. My criticism of OpenAI is also its pseudo-open source and true profitability, humorous self-positioning, and ridiculous power struggle. It&#x27;s not the regional user policy that you keep talking about, just care about whether you can use that broken dialogue.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@szguan 道友真乃妙人。吾付费订阅PLUS整年，所费几何？岂容道友评价升米斗米。吾所诟病者，乃OpenAI之伪开源真盈利，其定位滑稽，权力斗争可笑，绝非尔等所言之地域性用户政策，仅关乎尔等能否使用耳。</details></li>
