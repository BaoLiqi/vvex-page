            <p>US stocks plummeted last Friday. I previously bought small-cap stocks with all my funds, thinking I would hold them for a long time. Unexpectedly, the small-cap stocks plummeted for three or four days. I kept enduring it, but last Friday&#x27;s crash was too much. I was afraid the market would continue to plummet, so I cut my losses and lost a fortune. I want to ask everyone, losing money in trading always affects my mentality. I feel like I might not be suitable for trading 😔? What should I do?</p>

                <p>甲子日，美洲股海骤降，昔日倾囊购入小盘股，欲持之以待天时。孰料风云突变，小盘股连跌三四日，强忍不发。庚子日暴跌，心惊胆战，恐市势崩颓，遂斩仓止损，血本无归。敢问诸位道友，交易亏损，心魔丛生，莫非天命不合修习此道？当若何？</p>
