        <div class="content">
            <p>US stocks plummeted last Friday. I had previously bought small-cap stocks with all my holdings, thinking of holding them for a while. I didn&#x27;t expect small-cap stocks to plummet for three or four days. I endured it all along, but I didn&#x27;t expect them to plummet on Friday. I was afraid that the market would continue to plummet, so I cut my losses and lost a lot of money. I want to ask everyone, losing money in trading always affects my mood. I feel like I&#x27;m not suitable for trading 😔? What should I do?</p>

                <p>上周五美股大跌，之前全仓买了小盘股，想着长拿一段时间。没想到小盘股暴跌了三四天，一直忍着，没想到周五暴跌，害怕市场继续暴跌下去，割肉了，亏死了。想问问大家，交易亏钱了，总是影响心态，感觉自己是不是不适合做交易😔？怎么办啊。</p>
