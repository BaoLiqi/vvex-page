        <h2>上周五美股亏了 20w 怎么办？</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>US stocks plummeted last Friday. I had previously bought small-cap stocks with all my holdings, planning to hold them for a while. Unexpectedly, small-cap stocks crashed for three or four days. I kept enduring it, but then there was a massive drop on Friday. Fearing that the market would continue to crash, I sold at a loss. I'm devastated. I want to ask everyone, losing money in trading always affects my mindset. I feel like I might not be suitable for trading 😔? What should I do?</p>
            <p>上周五美股大跌，之前全仓买了小盘股，想着长拿一段时间。没想到小盘股暴跌了三四天，一直忍着，没想到周五暴跌，害怕市场继续暴跌下去，割肉了，亏死了。想问问大家，交易亏钱了，总是影响心态，感觉自己是不是不适合做交易😔？怎么办啊。</p>

                <li>How can the words "full position", "small-cap stocks", and "hold for a long time" be put together?<br>全仓 小盘股 长拿一段时间这几个词是怎么放到一起的</li><li>If you're not suitable, then don't do it. Buying some index funds and pretending to be dead might be more effective.<br>不适合就别做了呗，买点指数装死不看可能效果更佳</li><li>@csys Aren't there many people on X promoting small-cap stocks, like hims and others?<br>@csys X 上不是有很多人推小盘股嘛，类似 hims 之类的。</li><li>Have you been watching too much V2EX? Every thread discussing finance is full of people blindly buying US stocks.<br>是不是 v 站看多了，每个讨论理财的下面都是无脑买美股的</li><li>I also sold my small-cap stocks at a loss.<br>小盘股我也是割肉的</li><li>Don't look, look again at the end of the year.<br>别看 年底再看</li><li>Acknowledge the loss.<br>认亏</li><li>Yes, you are not suitable for trading. If 200k is just the value in RMB, it further proves that you are not suitable.<br>是的，你不适合做交易20w 如果只是人民币价值的话，更说明不适合。</li><li>The loss is just 1/100 of your total... haven't sold, planning to buy more.<br>亏的刚好是你的 1/100...没割肉, 还打算加仓</li><li>Gambler stock trading style.<br>赌徒炒股方式</li><li>Hold on to it.<br>拿着</li><li>You need to be able to accept how much you can lose if you want to earn. That's why I haven't tried these investments that could lose a lot of money.<br>想赚多少就要能接受亏多少，所以我后面没再尝试过这些可能亏很多的理财了</li><li>It always affects your mindset, and you feel like you're not suitable for trading 😔? --- That's how everyone (ordinary people) is. I suggest you think carefully about how to operate. Listening to other people's suggestions will likely lead to more regrets later.<br>总是影响心态，感觉自己是不是不适合做交易😔？---大家(普通人)都是这样。建议你自己好好想想怎么操作吧，听别人的建议后面大概率会更后悔。</li><li>@ulala Indexes will also fall. You can't judge whether it's a bear market or a bull market now. After it goes up, there are too many uncertainties, and inflation is rising again.<br>@ulala 指数也会跌啊，你不能判断现在是熊市还是牛市。上去之后，不确定的太多了，通胀又起来了</li><li>@565656 What if it disappears by the end of the year?

Holding for the long term is also the same as ordinary people, I can't hold on.<br>@Donahue 接受不了啊，亏了心态不好，很容易崩溃。拿长线也跟普通人一样，拿不住。</li><li>I used to buy penny stocks, small-cap stocks, and Chinese concept stocks, and I lost terribly. More than 100k went in, and I'm afraid there's not much left now. Some of the stocks have been delisted. I'm just pretending to be dead.<br>我之前买毛票，小盘股和中概股，亏得一塌糊涂，100 多个进去，现在怕是不剩多少了，一些票都退市了，我反正在装死</li><li>@ulala Trading in 2025 feels much more difficult than in 2024 and 2023, with more uncertainty. US stocks fluctuate greatly.<br>@ulala 2025 年交易，感觉比 2024 ，2023 ，难太多了，不确定性多。美股大起大落。</li>
