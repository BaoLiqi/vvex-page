1. Let&#x27;s talk about the background first.

   I&#x27;ve loved playing games since I was a kid, and most of the time it&#x27;s been online games, so here&#x27;s my ranking of online games I&#x27;ve played.

  《MapleStory》, it&#x27;s a trash game now, but it will always be number one in my heart, from fifth grade of elementary school to graduation, to work.

   The longest time I&#x27;ve played should be 《League of Legends》, I miss the days of playing with my college classmates.

   I miss the time before version 80 of 《DNF》, when I played with my childhood friends.

   I haven&#x27;t played games for more than a year, and now I feel like playing games is like going to work..


2. By the way, let me introduce this ranking tool, welcome to use it.

1 、先说背景 

   从小到大最爱玩游戏了，大部分时间都是网游，所以在这里说下我心中的网游排名。  
   
  《冒险岛》，现在是一款垃圾游戏，但是在我心中永远是第一位，从小学五年玩到毕业，玩到工作 
  
   玩的最久的应该是《英雄联盟》，怀念和大学同学一起开黑的日子 
   
   怀念《 dnf 》 80 版本之前，和发小一起玩的时光。  
   
   已经一年多没玩游戏了，现在感觉玩游戏就像上班一样。。

The game mode of online games is strictly affected by the network hardware environment and the configuration of the public. Therefore, online games are often full of various compromises of the times. The evaluation of online games can only be compared horizontally at that time point. For example, Stone Age and Magic Baby, although there is overlapping operating time, are completely two generations of games from the perspective of mechanism design and developer flow. So although the game quality of Magic Baby itself crushes Stone Age in all dimensions, in my understanding, Stone Age is superior to Magic Baby. Similarly, the MMO Blade &amp; Soul, which pioneered the &quot;no&quot; lock mode, is also a great game, although its number of monsters on the same screen and synchronization rate are beaten by Warcraft. Both are &quot;piling up and standing still&quot;, EVE&#x27;s completely free market and more attribute dimensions of battleships are much better than the Dragon Slaying Knife in Legend of Mir killing everything.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我个人理解，网游的评价维度，和单机游戏完全不同。网游的游戏模式，严格受到网络硬件环境，以及大众配置的直接影响。所以网游往往充满各种时代的妥协。网游的评价也只能按照当时的时间点来横向比较。比如石器时代和魔力宝贝，虽然有重叠的运营时间，但无论从机制设计、还是开发人员流转的角度上讲，是完全两个世代的游戏。所以虽然魔力宝贝的游戏素质本身全维度碾压石器，但在我的理解中，石器时代是优于魔力宝贝的。同理，开创“无”锁定模式的 MMO 剑灵，虽然他的同屏怪物数量、同步率被魔兽吊打，但也是很伟大的游戏。都是“扎堆站桩”，EVE 的完全自由市场、战舰更多的属性维度，就比热血传奇的屠龙刀秒杀一切，要强很多。</details></li><li>There&#x27;s MapleStory!

MapleStory, when I was in the 4th grade of elementary school, my brother dragged me to the computer cafe, and I wasn&#x27;t even as tall as the computer. 2. World of Warcraft, still playing it now. 3. Lost Ark, just started, played to the female BOSS, the old bull next. I forgot what it&#x27;s called, the game is good but it was ruined by the planners. 4. LOL, occasionally play a game with friends, it&#x27;s so tiring. 5. DNF, go up every year to get a set of sky, I didn&#x27;t have money when I was a child, I was so greedy. Then uninstall it. 6. Crazy Racing, I personally think it&#x27;s more fun than KartRider, haha. 7. MU Online, raised money to buy Dafei. 8. CF, played all night long, the happiest time was brushing fatigue in the first half of the night, playing guns in the middle, and watching xxx in the second half of the night. 9. JianWang3? Played with classmates for a while in college, the review is not as good as WoW. 10. FF14? Played it when it first opened, it was very novel. But I don&#x27;t like the art style. 11.
