            <p>For my first car in life, I&#x27;m relatively resistant to electric cars. I can accept joint venture fuel vehicles or Xiaomi, but I&#x27;m reluctant to consider other brands.

I&#x27;m single, 28 years old, with a mortgage of 3k, personal savings of 250k, and plan to spend 150k~200k on a car.

I usually don&#x27;t need a car to go to work because I live in the room next to the office. I rent a car to go home on holidays (150km each way). I&#x27;ve rented a Roewe I5, Toyota Levin, and Volkswagen Lavida for 4 consecutive years. According to my calculations, I only drive about 1500km a year.
Because I&#x27;m almost 190cm tall, even with the seats of A-class sedans pulled all the way back, they&#x27;re still a bit small. So, I&#x27;m targeting B-class cars/mid-size SUVs.

During the Chinese New Year, I had nothing to do at home, so I test drove various brands in the auto city for a week and immediately fell in love with the Buick Envision PLUS 2025 model.
My cousin-in-law, who works in automotive management and maintenance, said that Buicks tend to have more minor issues after 40,000 kilometers and recommends the Toyota RAV4.
Another cousin-in-law, who supplies auto parts, didn&#x27;t offer any opinions and just said to buy what I like.

Personally, I find Toyota&#x27;s interior unacceptable, but its reputation is for being durable and fuel-efficient.
Buick cars feel very comfortable to sit in, and the driving experience is also very comfortable. The disadvantages are that they don&#x27;t hold their value well, have more minor issues, and have high fuel consumption.
Or, I could simply change course and grit my teeth and get a Xiaomi, hoping to drive it home by the end of the year after waiting in line for 8 months.

The car brand situation in my extended family is: Honda x2, Toyota x1, Audi x1, Volkswagen x1, Great Wall x1, Mazda x1, Lincoln x1, Buick x1, Ford x1, Li Auto x1, BYD x1</p>

                <p>人生中第一辆车，对电车相对抵触，能接受合资燃油车、或者小米，其他品牌比较抗拒。

单身，28 ，房贷 3k ，个人存款 25w ，计划 15~20w 用于购车。

平时上班住在办公室隔壁房间也不用车，节假日回家 150km ，一般会租车回家，连续 4 年租过：荣威 I5 、丰田雷凌、大众朗逸，个人计算也就是一年 1500km 的水平。
因为身高接近 190 ，A 级小轿车座椅拉到最后还是有点不够用，所以目标放在 B 级车/中型 SUV 上。

过年期间在家没事干，汽车城各大品牌试驾了一个礼拜，一眼相中 别克 昂科威 PLUS 2025 款。
堂姐夫从事汽车管理维护相关工作，表示别克 4w 公里之后小毛病会比较多，推荐 丰田荣放。
另一个堂姐夫从事汽车零配件供应，没提任何意见，只说买自己喜欢的就行。

个人感觉丰田的内饰让我无法接受，但是口碑就是耐用和省油。
别克的车坐上去就感觉很舒服，驾驶体验也很舒适，缺点就是不保值、小毛病多、油耗高。
或者干脆换个赛道，咬咬牙上小米，排队 8 个月还有希望年底开回家。

                <li>Buying a Xiaomi with your height will screw you over. I&#x27;m not as tall as you, but close, and the sun visor area in the driver&#x27;s seat is covered in hair oil. Buy something with more space, test drive more, domestic cars are also very good. I think the Geely Xingyue L is the best value for the price. I&#x27;ve driven a colleague&#x27;s Volkswagen Tiguan, which is just a shell and the badge isn&#x27;t as good as a Tank.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你这个身高买小米坑死你，我没你高也差不多，驾驶位遮阳板附近上蹭的全是头油。买空间大的，多试驾，国产车也很好，我觉得这价格吉利星越 L 最香了。大众开过同事的途观，空有一副皮囊和标不如坦克香。</details></li><li>Is the RAV4 the kind of &#x27;power beast&#x27; where pressing the accelerator feels like nothing when it&#x27;s full of people?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>RAV4 就是那个坐满人以后踩油门像没踩到一样的动力猛兽吗</details></li><li>You don&#x27;t need to buy a car at all in your situation, but since you specifically mentioned Xiaomi, then just buy a Xiaomi.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你这情况根本不需要买车，但是你单独说了 小米，那就买小米吧</details></li><li>@dynastysea You don&#x27;t think you can buy a used Xiaomi for half the price, do you?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@dynastysea 你不会以为二手小米可以半价买吧？</details></li><li>Choosing what you like should be based on familiarity. Saying you like something without familiarity is just letting fragments of social bias dominate your mind.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>自己喜欢的选择是应该建立在自己熟悉的基础上没有熟悉说喜欢，就是任由社会偏见的碎片在自己的脑海中作威作福</details></li><li>@leonme #56 This year, because I had to go on a business trip out of town near the Chinese New Year and wasn&#x27;t sure when I could return, I rented a car late. All the cars I liked were already rented out. The rental platforms I usually use only had a bunch of electric cars left that no one was renting. I managed to refresh and find a fuel car, a Volkswagen T-Roc, from January 25th to February 4th, 12 days, full insurance was 3372 yuan, but the extension was expensive at 200 yuan/day, and the pick-up distance was 60km (train station), so I canceled the order. On another platform, I rented a Volkswagen Lavida XR, from January 24th to February 9th, 16 days, full insurance 4335 yuan, pick-up distance 5km (Wanda Plaza). The rented cars are all new cars within 2 years, and the store had already done a maintenance check before picking up the car, and I didn&#x27;t encounter any problems. PS: I have encountered a nail in the tire during a previous rental, but it only caused a slight pressure leak and did not affect the use, and there was no compensation.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@leonme #56 今年因为临过年去外地出差，不确定什么时候能回来，租车比较晚，喜欢的车都租出去了常用的租车平台只剩下一堆电车没人租，插空刷新到一辆燃油车，大众途岳 1 月 25 日~2 月 4 日，12 天，满额保险 3372 元，但是续租 200 元/天比较贵，而且提车距离 60km （火车站），就取消订单了在另一个平台上，租了大众朗逸新锐，1 月 24 日~2 月 9 日，16 天，满额保险 4335 元，提车距离 5km （万达广场）租的车都是 2 年内新车，取车前店里已经提前做了一次保养，未遇到任何故障PS：以前租车遇到过使用过程中车胎扎了钉子，但是只是轻微泄压，不影响使用，也没赔付</details></li><li>People who know cars don&#x27;t understand you. You need to know that buying something is buying it for yourself.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>懂车的人 不懂你。要知道买东西是买给自己的</details></li><li>CRV or Model Y<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>crv 或者 model y</details></li><li>Buy it, you definitely have to buy it. The people who suggest not buying have already bought one and forgotten the meaning of the first car for a man. They forgot the impulse of buying their first car. You have to walk some roads yourself, and only after trying them can you know if they are useful or not. And don&#x27;t underestimate the annual mileage of 1500km. The OP emphasized in #22 that he is an older single fat宅 (otaku). Having a car gives you a bonus when picking up girls. I suggest the poster go directly for BB (BMW, Benz) + Porsche + Xiaomi, don&#x27;t even look at A-class cars. After all, you are not married yet and now is the time to need brand value to add points to finding a partner. Buy early and enjoy early!<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>买啊，必须买。建议不买的人，都是买过了 忘了第一辆车对于一个男人的意义。忘了自己第一次买车时候的冲动。有些路得自己走过了，尝试过了才知道。有用还是没用。而且别看 1500km 的年公里数。op 在#22 中强调了 大龄单身肥宅了。有车对于泡妹子是有加分的。 建议楼主直接 BB+保时米，A 都不用看了。毕竟还没结婚 现在正是需要品牌价值给自己加分找对象的时候。 早买早享受！</details></li><li>If I were you, I would refer to the opinions of people who know cars (mainly to pay attention to which points, and the characteristics of various brands), and then choose the car I like myself. However, I think I know more about cars, so I chose it directly. I chose Lynk &amp; Co 01, and it&#x27;s been almost three years now, and I have no complaints and still like it very much. So the conclusion is: you must choose what you like, but you must reserve some knowledge to avoid falling into the pit.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>是我是你的话，我会参考懂车的人的意见（主要是要关注哪些点，以及各种品牌的特点），然后自己选择自己喜欢的车。不过我自己以为还是比较懂车的，所以直接自己选了，我选了领克 01 ，目前快三年了，没有任何抱怨，依旧非常喜欢。所以结论就是：一定要选自己喜欢的，但是要储备一些知识避免跳坑。</details></li><li>Don&#x27;t buy if it&#x27;s not a necessity. If you want to buy, buy one for less than 100k. With only 250k in savings, are you crazy to buy a 300k car? How are you going to live your life later?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>不是刚需就不买，要买就买 10w 以下的，就 25w 存款 买 30w 车不要命了？后面日子还过不过了</details></li><li>Just buy what you like. Also, using company stuff doesn&#x27;t count as freeloading.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>买自己喜欢的就行。另外用公司东西不算白嫖</details></li><li>A car recommended by a mechanic would be better. I bought a BYD Seal 06 that I liked for commuting, and now there is some abnormal noise in the driver&#x27;s side door. The range and fuel consumption are not as good as what is said online!<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>修车推荐的会好点买了台自己喜欢的代步海豹 06 ，现在主驾驶门有点异响。续航以及油耗也没有网上说的那么好！</details></li><li>You excluded electric cars, but specifically added Xiaomi, which means you are quite satisfied with Xiaomi; but think about it this way, if you don&#x27;t have any major expenses this year, Xiaomi is also worth considering, after all, your savings will definitely increase in 8 months.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你排除了电车，却单独加了小米，说明对小米还是比较满意的；但是你换个想法，要是今年没有大的支出，小米也是可以考虑的，毕竟 8 个月的时间，你的存款不会不涨</details></li><li>Add more money and get a Xiaomi. Buy what you like.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>加钱小米，买自己喜欢的</details></li><li>Buy a used Xiaomi, what are you trying to achieve by buying a gasoline car in your situation?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>买个二手小米吧，你这情况买油车是图啥呢</details></li><li>If you don&#x27;t drive much, buying an electric car is not cost-effective. American cars are indeed good, with better configurations than Japanese and German cars, and larger space. Don&#x27;t even mention the resale value, there are no cars that hold their value now. The fuel consumption is indeed high, but you don&#x27;t drive much anyway. In summary, I recommend you buy a Buick.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>开的少，买电车确实不划算，美系车确实可以，配置比日系德系好，空间大，保值就别提了，现在就没有保值的车，油耗确实高，不过本来你就开的不多，综上，推荐你买别克</details></li><li>With the same height, I suggest you take some time to test drive all the target models, some cars look big, but the headroom in the main driver is very small, because of some design reasons such as sunroofs. I personally bought a compact SUV, but in fact, the headroom is not as good as a Santana without a sunroof, and it leaks water every time it&#x27;s blocked.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>身高一样，我建议你花点时间把目标车型都试驾、试乘一下，有些车看着大，但是主驾头部空间很小，因为天窗等一些设计原因，我个人买的某紧凑 SUV ，但实际上头部空间还不如没有天窗的桑塔纳，且堵一次就漏一次水</details></li><li>Buy what you like. If you buy what others recommend and you&#x27;re not happy, you&#x27;ll regret it forever...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>买自己喜欢的，别人推荐的，万一不顺心，以后会一直后悔的……</details></li><li>Those who have never owned a car cannot understand the pain of repairing a car. You have to experience the loss before you understand.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>没养过车的都体会不了修车痛苦，亏还是得吃过后才能明白。</details></li>
