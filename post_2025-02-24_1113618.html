            <p>I am more concerned about privacy and security and don't usually play mobile games. So, will iOS become slow if I keep updating it until Apple stops supporting it?</p>
            <p>个人更关注隐私和安全，平时不玩手游。那么 ios 一直更新到苹果放弃维护，会卡吗？</p>

                <li>Don't listen to the first floor, it is common sense that a piece of hardware that is updated with the OS for 5 consecutive years will definitely become slow.<br>别听一楼的，一款硬件连着更新 5 年 OS 一定会卡，这是基本常识</li><li>It's very smooth if you don't use domestic software. I often see people abroad still using 8p and x, and there are no problems at all.<br>不用国产软件很流畅 在国外经常看到还在用 8p 和 x 的 完全没问题</li><li>If you care about privacy and security, you must upgrade. Whether it is slow or not depends on whether you use domestic software and play games.<br>在乎隐私和安全必须升级卡不卡取决你用不用国产软件和玩游戏</li><li>If the new system isn't slow, then there's no need to sell new phones.<br>新系统不卡，那新手机也不用卖了</li><li>It depends on your understanding of lag. Hardware is not like before, lag is easy to occur. Apple's lag now occurs more often after the battery life is reduced, which is caused by frequency locking. My iOS is always kept up to date. ip6p. If I remember correctly, IOS9 was upgraded to IOS11 or 12, and all kinds of lag started. The famous frequency lock started here. IP8P, I used it until I had a 13P. Except for the heat generated by playing King of Glory, which caused the frequency reduction lag, there was no problem. (Battery replaced 2 times) 13P, still, when the battery life dropped to 77%, some operations felt significantly slower. Especially killing the background is very serious. Now it is 16PM. Killing the background has been alleviated, but sometimes it will kill the background after opening the camera. Sometimes some APPs are left for a long time, but they can be restored normally...<br>这要看你对卡顿理解了。现在硬件不像以前，卡顿容易出现。苹果现在卡顿更多出现在电池寿命减少后，锁频导致的。我 IOS 都是一直保持最新的。ip6p 。没记错是 IOS9 升到 IOS11 还是 12 就开始各种卡顿了。著名的锁频就是这里开始了。IP8P ，用到我还 13P ，除了打王者发热导致降频卡顿，没什么问题。（电池换了 2 次）13P ，还是电池寿命掉到 77%开始，一些操作感觉到明显慢了。特别杀后台非常严重。现在是 16PM 。杀后台有缓解，但有时候开相机后就必杀。有时候一些 APP 放 N 久，却可以正常恢复。。。</li><li>Feel free to update within 2 years, but definitely don't update after 3+ years... I've switched to Android.<br>2 年以内随便更新，3+千万就千万不要更新。。。已转安卓。</li><li>I still agree with Andy-Bill's Law.<br>安迪-比尔定律，我还是很认同的</li><li>I always update automatically. Normally, you will have to replace your phone in 5 years at most. You won't feel any lag in these 5 years of upgrades (PS: I don't play games on my phone, so I don't know if the game is slow or not).<br>一直都是自动更新，正常来说你手机最多 5 年就要换了，这 5 年升级完全不会感觉到卡的（ PS：不在手机上玩游戏，游戏卡不卡不知道）</li><li>@CodeUU TrollStore requires a system before iOS18 to be used. After installing TrollStore, use Filza to modify the file to lock the frame rate.<br>@CodeUU 巨魔 TrollStore 需要是 iOS18 之前的系统才能用，装好巨魔后用 Filza 修改文件锁帧</li><li>Apple machines can currently get updates for five years after release. If you are more concerned about security and privacy, it is definitely recommended to keep updating, and you said that you don't play games, so it won't be slow. It's just that a lot of software with pile-of-shit code will make the App unable to hang in the background.<br>苹果机目前是发售后可以获得五年更新，如果你更关注安全隐私那是肯定建议一直更新，而且你都说了不玩游戏其实并不会卡的，只是很多软件屎山代码会让 App 挂不住后台而已。</li><li>@alect That's great<br>@alect 那太好了</li><li>It will be slow. My mini5 was a bit slow after upgrading to 17, and very slow after upgrading to 18. There is a noticeable delay in operation.<br>会卡， 我的 mini5 升级到 17 后 有点卡升级到 18 后 很卡，操作明显延迟</li><li>I usually update to the next major version after the factory version.<br>我一般是更新到出厂版本的下一个大版本。</li><li>iPad mini5 has stopped at 17, and iPhone 13 pro is planned to stop at 18.<br>iPad mini5 已停在 17 ，iPhone 13 pro 计划停在 18</li><li>It should depend on the memory.<br>应该是看内存吧</li><li>I haven't updated, and I haven't found it slow.<br>我一直没更新，没有发现卡。</li><li>@Configuration Then how many years is it appropriate to upgrade? For example, I currently have 14, which iOS should I upgrade to for retirement?<br>@Configuration 那升级几年合适？比如我现在手上是 14 ，升到 ios 几养老？</li><li>@xxopp Every time you upgrade, it will be a little slower, but the perception is not strong in the first two or three years.<br>@xxopp 每升级一次都会卡一点点，前面两、三年感知不强罢了</li><li>@nothing2 Don't upgrade, I just wanted to gamble and upgrade to 18 the other day...<br>@nothing2 千万别升级 ，前两天我就是想赌一把升级到 18 。。。</li><li>@xxopp If you are more concerned about privacy and security, there is only one option, always upgrade to the latest version<br>@xxopp 如果你更关注隐私和安全，那就只有一个选择，永远升级到最新版本</li>
