                <li>Don&#x27;t listen to the first floor, a piece of hardware updating the OS for 5 years will definitely slow down, this is basic common sense<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>莫听一楼之言，凡器历五载之灵更，必有损耗，此乃常理</details></li><li>It&#x27;s very smooth without using domestic software. I often see people using 8p and x abroad without any problems.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>远离俗世之秽，则流畅如初。常于海外见人用八代、十代，未见其滞也。</details></li><li>Caring about privacy and security requires upgrading. Whether it lags depends on whether you use domestic software and play games.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>重隐匿与安全，必先升华灵台。至于顿挫与否，则视乎是否沾染俗世之法，以及是否沉迷玩乐。</details></li><li>If the new system doesn&#x27;t lag, then the new phone doesn&#x27;t need to be sold.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>若新系统不滞，则新机何售？</details></li><li>It depends on your understanding of lag. Nowadays, hardware is not like before, and lag is prone to occur. Apple&#x27;s lag now appears more after the battery life is reduced, which leads to frequency locking. My iOS has always been kept up to date. ip6p. If I remember correctly, it was iOS9 upgraded to iOS11 or 12 that started to experience various lags. The famous frequency locking started here. IP8P, used until I had 13P, except for the frequency reduction caused by heating from playing king, there was no problem. (Battery replaced 2 times) 13P, still starting when the battery life dropped to 77%, some operations felt obviously slow. Especially killing the background is very serious. Now it&#x27;s 16PM. Killing the background has been alleviated, but sometimes it will kill after opening the camera. Sometimes some APPs are left for a long time, but they can recover normally...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>顿挫之解，在于道友之心。今之硬件，异于往昔，顿挫易显。苹婆之滞，多因电精损耗，锁频所致。吾之灵台，常保至新。ip6p，忆昔乃九升至十一二，始有顿挫之感。锁频之名，亦由此起。IP8P，用至吾有十三代，除却王者发热降频，无甚大碍。（电精易二）十三代，仍自电精耗至七七始，觉察操作渐缓。杀后台尤甚。今用十六神机。杀后台稍缓，然偶开摄灵之器，必遭清扫。然有俗缘，历久弥坚，竟可复原…</details></li><li>Update casually within 2 years, don&#x27;t update after 3+...

Normally, your phone will need to be replaced in 5 years at most.

If you are more concerned about security and privacy, it is definitely recommended to keep updating, and since you said you don&#x27;t play games, it won&#x27;t be slow, it&#x27;s just that a lot of software&#x27;s sh*t code will make the App unable to hang in the background.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>苹婆之器，发售后可获五载灵更。若道友重安全隐匿，当 지속升级，且既云不涉嬉戏，自无顿挫之虞。唯是众多俗物，秽码缠身，致使灵App难驻后台。</details></li><li>@alect That&#x27;s great<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@alect 甚好甚好</details></li><li>It will lag, my mini5 upgraded to 17 and it&#x27;s a bit slow, upgraded to 18 and it&#x27;s very slow, the operation is obviously delayed<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>灵台必将滞涩，吾之mini5升至十七已微感不畅，升至十八则甚为迟缓，运作迟滞显著。</details></li><li>I usually update to the next major version of the factory version.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾多升至出厂之版本之次一大版。</details></li><li>iPad mini5 has stopped at 17, iPhone 13 pro plans to stop at 18<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>平板mini5止步于十七，灵机十三pro计划停留在十八。</details></li><li>It should depend on the memory<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>盖视乎灵石多寡。</details></li><li>I haven&#x27;t updated it all the time, and I haven&#x27;t found it to be slow.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>吾久不更迭，未觉迟缓。</details></li><li>@Configuration So how many years is it appropriate to upgrade?
