            <p>The thing is, my parents suddenly said they ordered a house. This house cannot be paid in installments, and my parents can&#x27;t afford the full amount. They placed the order in this situation. Yesterday, they suddenly told me about it and asked me to discuss it and give them more than 200,000 yuan. I don&#x27;t know what to say.</p>

                <li>A house that can be bought for more than 400,000 yuan will probably not be sold for 100,000 yuan in the future.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>总价 40 多万能买得到的房子，以后大概率 10 万都卖不掉</details></li><li>Stupid, just throw the problem back at them. Are they going to sell blood?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>傻吧 你再把问题丢回去不就好了 难不成要卖血</details></li><li>The fact that they can do this shows that they still treat you like a child and haven&#x27;t considered your feelings.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>能这么操作，说明还把你当小孩，没考虑到你的想法</details></li><li>Is it bought for you or your brother?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>给你买的还是给你弟买的？</details></li><li>A house with a price of 400,000 is probably a house in a small place. According to the situation in a small place, it will probably continue to depreciate in the future, and the depreciated money will definitely be greater than the current deposit.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>房价 40 万大概率是小地方的房子，按照小地方的情况后续大概率还会继续贬值，贬值的钱肯定大于目前的定金。</details></li><li>Blind guess, OP should have experienced a wave of marriage urging during the Chinese New Year. OP&#x27;s parents recently saw no hope for OP&#x27;s marital status, so they decided to push it and simply go all out and order the future wedding room without discussing it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>盲猜，OP 过年期间应该经历过一波催婚，OP 对婚姻的状态令父母近期看不到希望，二老决定 push 一把，干脆一不做二不休，不商量就把未来的婚房给订了</details></li><li>You should say: No money.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>你应该说: 没钱</details></li><li>If you don&#x27;t have money, you can only lose the deposit.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>没钱，顶多赔掉定金</details></li><li>It&#x27;s easy to get a bank loan now, and farmers can also get loans. Let them take out a loan to pay the house payment; then slowly repay the loan to the bank.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>现在银行贷款很容易的，农民也能贷款，让他们贷款把房款付了；银行那边贷款再慢慢还咯</details></li><li>Many parents are like this, used to making decisions for their children.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>很多家长都这样，替孩子做决策做惯了。</details></li><li>@kk2syc It wasn&#x27;t bought for me, I&#x27;m an only child.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@kk2syc 不是给我买的，我是独生子</details></li><li>If you are a property inheritor, you can consider supporting it; if the house is worth far more than 200,000, and you are just using your money to fill some gaps, you can consider it; if it is clear that the house is bought for another child, you can consider lending it; (To be honest, I subconsciously think that everyone who complains about their parents is relatively selfish, of course this is my prejudice)<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>如果自己是财产继承者，就可以考虑支持；如果房子价值远大于 20 万，只是用你钱补一些空缺，可以考虑；如果明确是买了房子给另一个子女，可以考虑借；（实话实说，所有吐槽父母的，我潜意识认为这人比较自私，当然这是我的偏见）</details></li><li>@Kaisar Speechless.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Kaisar 太无语了</details></li><li>Then just follow the procedure of placing an order but not being able to afford it to solve it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>那就按照下了订，但是买不起的程序来解决就是啦</details></li><li>@Messmer You are an only child, but it wasn&#x27;t bought for you, what&#x27;s the situation?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Messmer 你是独生子，但是又不是给你买的，啥情况？</details></li><li>@DigitaIOcean The house now costs more than 400,000, and my parents only have more than 200,000 in savings. I am an only child and a property inheritor. They suddenly told me about this, and they placed the order directly without discussing it with me.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@DigitaIOcean 房子现在价格是 40 多万，父母存款只有 20 多万，我是独生子，是财产继承者，是突然跟我说了这件事，而且没跟我讨论直接下订了</details></li><li>@Messmer #12 This situation is indeed a bit awkward.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Messmer #12 确实有点尴尬这情况。</details></li><li>It&#x27;s true that they were wrong not to discuss it, but since you are the inheritor, it means your parents gave you a sum of money.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>没商量确实是他们不对，不过既然是继承者，说明是父母给了你一笔钱哦</details></li><li>@Messmer #12 One possible reference, you don&#x27;t have money or don&#x27;t want to pay, but you also like the house. Just buy it first, and then take out a mortgage loan (with a very low interest rate) and let your parents or yourself pay the installments.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Messmer #12 一种可能的参考，你没有钱或者不想出钱，但房子你也看得上。 就先买了，然后房屋抵押贷款(利率很低的)，让父母或者自己支付分期款。</details></li><li>@loooooong2023 But I&#x27;m really speechless that they placed the order directly without discussing it with me, and they can&#x27;t pay in installments and can&#x27;t afford the full amount.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@loooooong2023 但我实在是无语没跟我讨论商量就直接下订了，而且无法分期付款又没能力付全款的情况</details></li>
