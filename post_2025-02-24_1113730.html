            <p>The thing is, my parents suddenly said they placed an order for a house that cannot be paid in installments, and my parents can&#x27;t afford the full amount either. They placed the order in this situation, and yesterday they suddenly told me about it and asked me to discuss it and asked me to give them more than 200,000 yuan. I don&#x27;t know what to say.</p>
