                <li>Very ethical, can you post your company name? I want to go<br>特别道德，能把咱公司名字发一下吗我想去</li><li>Speaking of which, I'll report one. They let me go before the official transfer without compensation. Shanghai Chuanghehui Education Technology, I hope v friends don't fall into the pit.<br>这么说的我就举报一个把，转正前让走人但没有赔偿的。上海创合汇教育科技，希望 v 友别进坑</li><li>@milala Wanting to scold but stopping<br>@milala 欲骂又止</li><li>@darksword21 I was the one who got eliminated<br>@darksword21 我是被淘汰的那个</li><li>It turns out that programmers are now easier to recruit than cleaners.<br>事实证明，程序员现在比保洁还好招。</li><li>@zuosiruan #14 People nowadays are like this, a bunch of cowards. When their interests are violated, they can only shout a little. When it comes to <real name>ing, they feel "dare not" "not good" hahahaha<br>@zuosiruan #14 现在的人是这样， 怂的一批，侵犯利益了，都只能叫一叫，真要<实名>一下，又觉得“不敢”“不好” 哈哈哈哈</li><li>Are you a dog?<br>你是狗么</li><li>@alexsz The difference is that you buy clothes and return them after wearing them for half a year.<br>@alexsz 不同在于买的衣服穿了半年要退货。</li><li>@alexsz If you buy two pairs at the same time to try on, and then return the unsuitable ones, this is an interview, not a probation period. If you say you wear both shoes for seven days, and then return one of them before the seven-day period expires, then there is no difference from what OP said.<br>@alexsz 如果同时买两双来试穿，然后退掉不合适的，这是面试，不是试用期。你要说两个鞋子都穿七天，然后七天到期之前退掉其中一双，那和 OP 这个美没什么不同</li><li>@milala #2 Then you should post the company name<br>@milala #2 那更应该发一下公司名字了</li><li>I think the current leadership and HR should be eliminated. This approach is completely lazy and bad. Recruiting should be about recruiting suitable people who meet the requirements. From the interview to the probation period, it should be about assessing whether the person meets the requirements and meets the job requirements. If they meet, stay, if they don't, leave. If the interview and probation period cannot be assessed, and you can only rely on the last-place elimination to select the best, then the leadership should just leave. They don't have this ability, what kind of leaders are they?<br>我觉得应该把现有领导层和 HR 淘汰掉这样的做法是完全的懒和坏招人应该是要招合适的，符合要求的，从面试到试用期都应该是在考察这个人是不是符合要求、满足岗位需求，符合就留，不符合就走如果面试和试用期都不能考察的出来，只能靠末位淘汰来择优的话，那领导层直接走好了，这点能力都没有，当什么领导</li><li>@matrix1010 Not rational at all. "Ensuring high talent density" relies on very reasonable interview strategies, high-level interviewers, and sufficiently good salary levels. Last-place elimination is a very, very lazy decision-making method. Either the priority of "recruiting" is set too low, or people are used improperly. For startups, getting involved in these two things is a sure path to death.<br>@matrix1010 一点也不理性。"确保高人才密度" 是要靠非常合理的面试策略、高水平的面试官外加足够好的薪资水平来保证的。末位淘汰是非常非常偷懒的决策方式，要么是把“招人”的优先级放的过低，要么是对人的使用不当。对创业公司来说，沾上这两条，离死不远了。</li><li>Isn't OP immediately exposing himself by saying the company name? What's the mentality of scolding people?<br>op 说了公司名称不是立刻就暴露了自己吗，骂人的是什么心态</li><li>Post the company name<br>公司名字发一下</li><li>I've encountered this before, I left directly<br>遇到过，我直接走了</li><li>Was there reasonable compensation? If it's unreasonable, go to arbitration directly<br>合理赔偿了吗，不合理直接仲裁</li><li>My company, but compensated for 1 month<br>我司，但赔了 1 个月</li><li>Just ditch them and don't go<br>直接放他们鸽子不去</li><li>OP is so miserable<br>OP 好惨</li><li>For technology startups, it's quite rational to do this. But the premise is that the last-place elimination is for all programmers in the company, not just these 2. If both are very good, recruit them and keep both after the break-in period and fire the company's lousy programmers. If 1 is good and 1 is not so good, it depends on whether the company has lousier ones, fire the lousier ones. For startups, talent is the core, and they should always try their best to ensure high talent density<br>对于技术型创业公司来说这么做挺理性. 但前提是末尾淘汰针对公司所有程序员，而不是这 2 个。如果是 2 个都很厉害的，招进来磨合完两个都要，把公司菜的程序员裁掉。如果 1 个厉害 1 个不怎么厉害，就看公司有没有更菜的，把更菜的裁掉。创业公司人才是核心，永远要尽可能去确保高人才密度</li>
