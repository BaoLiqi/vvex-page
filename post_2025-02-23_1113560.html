        <h1>Should a novice Android developer give up?</h1>
        <h2>菜鸟 Android 开发该放弃了吗？</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I am an individual developer with a technology stack of Java, Kotlin, and Compose. I worked as a full-time developer in 2021, and then changed careers. However, I have continued to follow Android development. My Kotlin and Compose related libraries on GitHub have a total of over a thousand stars, and I consider myself to have a decent grasp of the relevant technologies.

Last year, I almost crashed and burned after switching careers, so I was preparing to come back and continue developing. I looked at Boss Zhipin for a week and only applied for junior positions within Guangdong Province. I sent out almost 30 resumes, including some outsourcing companies that proactively asked for my resume. I didn't expect to not even get a single interview. Is it because I made a fatal mistake by changing careers/having too long of a gap, or is the internet client-side market really that cold?

Should I continue to look for Android jobs, or should I switch careers? For example, switching to front-end React/NextJS? I am personally more familiar with these two, but I don't have any corporate project experience, so I really don't know how to find a job. And with the maturity of tools like v0 and Cursor, will the front-end become even more difficult than Android?

Please give me some advice!</p>
            <p>个人开发者，技术栈是 Java 、Kotlin 和 Compose 。21 年做过全职开发，之后就转行了，也有持续关注 Android 开发，GitHub 上 Kotlin 、Compose 相关的库一起大概有一千多的星，自认为相关技术掌握度还可以。

去年转行踩大雷几乎被搞垮准备回来继续做开发，看了一个星期的 Boss 直聘，只投了广东省内初级的，投了快 30 份简历，包括一些外包主动问我要简历的。没想到现在一个面试都没，是转行/空窗期太长犯了大忌还是互联网客户端真的这么凉了吗？

该不该继续找安卓的，还是转行？比如转到前端的 React/NextJS ？个人对这两个比较熟一点，但是没有企业项目经验也属实不知道怎么找，而且 v0 、Cursor 之类的工具成熟之后前端会不会比 Android 更难？

还请各位大佬指点指点！</p>

                <li>Here's my evaluation of HarmonyOS from 2023, which is still valid in 2025. Huawei's phones for the market will continue to use the shell-like HarmonyOS system. NEXT will be very difficult to push to the market. HarmonyOS has hundreds of millions of users, but it is a shell system mixed with Android. If it is OTA to NEXT, Huawei cannot solve the problem of old applications. Android has millions of apps, and if it is upgraded, hundreds of millions of users will not be able to use it directly. Relying on the few apps that are signed, without the driving force of the natural market, it cannot support the ecosystem. Ordinary users see that Xiaohongshu has adapted to HarmonyOS, and subconsciously think that all Android functions have been migrated. They may even think that HarmonyOS has optimized the package size very well, which is impossible. Android functions that have invested so much manpower cannot be copied at once. In the end, it will only be a few adapted pages. Most of the signed adaptations will eventually be a simplified speed version app for the elderly. And after they adapt, will they still iterate normally? I think most of them will be done with the 1.0 version and there will be no follow-up.<br>贴一下我 23 年对鸿蒙的评价了，如今 2025 依然有效。华为面向市场的手机，会一直维持套壳的 鸿蒙系统，next 几乎很难推向市场.鸿蒙 os 是有大量几亿用户，但这是混合了 Android 的套壳系统，如果 ota 到 NEXT ，华为无法解决老应用的问题，Android 几百万 app ，一升级几亿用户直接没法用.靠着签约那寥寥无几的 app ，没有自然市场的推力是无法支撑生态的普通用户看到小红书适配了鸿蒙，潜意识会觉得迁移了所有的 Android 功能，甚至他们会觉得鸿蒙的包体积优化的很好，实际不可能，android 投入那么多人力做的功能，不可能一下复制出来。最后只会是适配几个页面。大部分签约适配的 最后 会是一个 老人精简极速版 app 。  并且他们适配完，是不是还正常的迭代？我想大部分都是做完 1.0 版本就没有下文了。</li><li>The HarmonyOS market is not as big as imagined. Most companies' HarmonyOS clients just randomly pick a few client-side colleagues, or directly send them out for external assignments. Once the functions are completed, they are basically gone, and there is basically no follow-up maintenance, so it is difficult to find positions. Before, I looked for HarmonyOS positions for more than half a month and found that the salary was low, the positions were few, and most of them were gone after three months. Even if they don't tell you that you only work for three months, most of them are laid off after a few months. There are very few HarmonyOS developers who offer stable positions.<br>鸿蒙市场远没有想象中那么大。大多数公司的鸿蒙客户端都是随便抽几个客户端同事，或者直接外派出去，功能搞完基本上就没了，基本上没有后续维护，所以也很难有岗位。 之前我找了半个多月的鸿蒙岗位，发现工资又低，岗位又少，而且大多数都是干三个月就没了，就算没有告诉你干三个月的，大多数也是干几个月就被裁了。 那种提供稳定的岗位的鸿蒙开发，太少了。</li><li>Android is now better off doing HarmonyOS, at least you can eat some dividends for a few years.<br>安卓现在还不如去搞鸿蒙，至少能吃几年红利</li><li>What career did you switch to that was a disaster?

I heard people say it's already at the bottom, but it turns out there is no bottom.

It is recommended to learn HarmonyOS, and then develop in the direction of large front-end and AI.<br>只能说很难，是整个客户端，前端都很难。建议学习鸿蒙，之后再往大前端，AI 方向发展</li><li>@july1995 Understood, thanks for providing the information. With this kind of market, it feels like it's even harder for novices to enter the industry than to find Android jobs.<br>@july1995 了解，感谢提供信息，这样的行情感觉小白入行比找安卓还要难</li><li>@TArysiyehua Thanks for the advice. It does feel like the client-side is very difficult. Most of the Android positions I see are either cross-platform, hardware, or HarmonyOS. I hardly see any Web client-side positions being recruited. Without considering going to the underlying layers, cross-platform and HarmonyOS may be the only spaces left.<br>@TArysiyehua 感谢建议，这样说确实感觉客户端都很难了，看到的大多安卓岗位要么跨端要么硬件要么鸿蒙，Web 也几乎没看到招客户端的。不考虑往底层走，可能只有跨端和鸿蒙还有点空间了。</li><li>'Last year, I switched careers and almost collapsed,' can you elaborate?<br>'去年转行踩大雷几乎被搞垮'，方便细说下吗</li><li>Just saw it, how would an individual developer get into farming... wow.<br>刚看到，个人开发者怎么会搞养殖去。。。我丢</li><li>Now, finding a job is difficult, and it's even more difficult if you've been out of work for too long, hahaha.<br>现在找工作，行情不好，空窗期太久的，就更难找了，哈哈哈哈</li><li>@LiuJiang Someone mentioned it upstairs, it has nothing to do with computers. But in the future, if someone really wants to enter the farming industry, don't just watch some videos, visit the market, and understand the market conditions before starting. You must find a reliable person in the industry to cooperate with. It is possible that a novice can make a profit without losing money just by luck.<br>@LiuJiang 楼上有说，跟计算机没关系，不过以后要是有人真想入行养殖，千万不要自己看点视频逛逛市场了解点行情就开始干，怎么也要找个靠谱的行内人合作，新手做到不赔也可能只是运气好</li><li>@LiuJiang It was still forced. Before AI programming became popular, I could still have some income from taking orders.
