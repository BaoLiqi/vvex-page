            <h3>菜鸟 Android 开发该放弃了吗？</h3>
        </details>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I am an individual developer with a tech stack of Java, Kotlin, and Compose. I worked as a full-time developer in 2021, and then switched careers. However, I have continued to follow Android development. I have over a thousand stars on GitHub for Kotlin and Compose-related libraries combined. I believe I have a good grasp of the related technologies.

Last year, I switched careers and almost went bankrupt due to a major setback. I was planning to come back to development, so I spent a week looking at Boss Zhipin, only applying for junior positions in Guangdong Province. I sent out almost 30 resumes, including some outsourcing companies that proactively asked for my resume. I didn&#x27;t expect to not even get a single interview. Is it because I made a big mistake by changing careers/having a long period of unemployment, or is the internet client-side market really that cold?

Should I continue to look for Android positions, or should I switch careers? For example, to frontend React/NextJS? I am relatively familiar with these two, but I don&#x27;t have any enterprise project experience so I really don&#x27;t know how to find a job. Also, after tools like v0 and Cursor become mature, will frontend be even more difficult than Android?

I would appreciate any guidance from experienced developers!</p>

                <p>个人开发者，技术栈是 Java 、Kotlin 和 Compose 。21 年做过全职开发，之后就转行了，也有持续关注 Android 开发，GitHub 上 Kotlin 、Compose 相关的库一起大概有一千多的星，自认为相关技术掌握度还可以。

去年转行踩大雷几乎被搞垮准备回来继续做开发，看了一个星期的 Boss 直聘，只投了广东省内初级的，投了快 30 份简历，包括一些外包主动问我要简历的。没想到现在一个面试都没，是转行/空窗期太长犯了大忌还是互联网客户端真的这么凉了吗？

该不该继续找安卓的，还是转行？比如转到前端的 React/NextJS ？个人对这两个比较熟一点，但是没有企业项目经验也属实不知道怎么找，而且 v0 、Cursor 之类的工具成熟之后前端会不会比 Android 更难？

还请各位大佬指点指点！</p>

                <li>Here&#x27;s my evaluation of HarmonyOS from 2023, which is still valid in 2025. Huawei&#x27;s phones for the market will continue to maintain a shell-like HarmonyOS system, and NEXT will be very difficult to push to the market. HarmonyOS has a large number of users, hundreds of millions, but it&#x27;s a shell system mixed with Android. If it&#x27;s OTA to NEXT, Huawei can&#x27;t solve the problem of old applications. Android has millions of apps, and hundreds of millions of users won&#x27;t be able to use them after the upgrade. Relying on the few apps signed, without the driving force of a natural market, it can&#x27;t support the ecosystem. Ordinary users seeing Xiaohongshu adapting to HarmonyOS will subconsciously think that all Android functions have been migrated, and they will even think that HarmonyOS has very good package size optimization, which is actually impossible. The functions that Android has invested so much manpower in cannot be copied all at once. In the end, it will only be adapted to a few pages. Most of the signed adaptations will eventually be an &quot;elderly simplified express version&quot; app. And after they adapt, will they still iterate normally? I think most of them will be done after version 1.0 and there will be no follow-up.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>贴一下我 23 年对鸿蒙的评价了，如今 2025 依然有效。华为面向市场的手机，会一直维持套壳的 鸿蒙系统，next 几乎很难推向市场.鸿蒙 os 是有大量几亿用户，但这是混合了 Android 的套壳系统，如果 ota 到 NEXT ，华为无法解决老应用的问题，Android 几百万 app ，一升级几亿用户直接没法用.靠着签约那寥寥无几的 app ，没有自然市场的推力是无法支撑生态的普通用户看到小红书适配了鸿蒙，潜意识会觉得迁移了所有的 Android 功能，甚至他们会觉得鸿蒙的包体积优化的很好，实际不可能，android 投入那么多人力做的功能，不可能一下复制出来。最后只会是适配几个页面。大部分签约适配的 最后 会是一个 老人精简极速版 app 。  并且他们适配完，是不是还正常的迭代？我想大部分都是做完 1.0 版本就没有下文了。</details></li><li>The HarmonyOS market is not nearly as big as people imagine. Most companies&#x27; HarmonyOS clients are just a few client-side colleagues randomly selected, or directly outsourced. Once the features are done, basically it&#x27;s over. There is basically no follow-up maintenance, so it&#x27;s difficult to find positions. I spent over half a month looking for HarmonyOS positions and found that the pay was low, there were few positions, and most of them only lasted three months. Even if they don&#x27;t tell you it&#x27;s for three months, most of them are laid off after a few months. There are very few HarmonyOS development positions that offer stable employment.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>鸿蒙市场远没有想象中那么大。大多数公司的鸿蒙客户端都是随便抽几个客户端同事，或者直接外派出去，功能搞完基本上就没了，基本上没有后续维护，所以也很难有岗位。 之前我找了半个多月的鸿蒙岗位，发现工资又低，岗位又少，而且大多数都是干三个月就没了，就算没有告诉你干三个月的，大多数也是干几个月就被裁了。 那种提供稳定的岗位的鸿蒙开发，太少了。</details></li><li>It&#x27;s better to work on HarmonyOS than Android now, at least you can enjoy a few years of dividends.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>安卓现在还不如去搞鸿蒙，至少能吃几年红利</details></li><li>What career did you switch to that backfired?

I heard people say it had reached the bottom, but it turns out there is no bottom. Newcomers are just there to give away money.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@liuzimin 是养殖，听了人说已经到谷底了，结果发现永远没有谷底，新手入行就是来送钱的</details></li><li>It&#x27;s just difficult, the entire client-side and front-end are difficult. It is recommended to learn HarmonyOS and then develop towards the big front-end and AI directions.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>只能说很难，是整个客户端，前端都很难。建议学习鸿蒙，之后再往大前端，AI 方向发展</details></li><li>@july1995 I understand, thanks for the information. In this market, it feels even harder for newbies to enter the field than to find an Android job.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@july1995 了解，感谢提供信息，这样的行情感觉小白入行比找安卓还要难</details></li><li>@TArysiyehua Thanks for the suggestion, based on what you are saying it really feels like the client-side is difficult. Most of the Android positions I see are either cross-platform, hardware, or HarmonyOS. I&#x27;ve hardly seen any Web positions hiring client-side devs. If I don&#x27;t consider going into the underlying layer, maybe only cross-platform and HarmonyOS have some space.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@TArysiyehua 感谢建议，这样说确实感觉客户端都很难了，看到的大多安卓岗位要么跨端要么硬件要么鸿蒙，Web 也几乎没看到招客户端的。不考虑往底层走，可能只有跨端和鸿蒙还有点空间了。</details></li><li>&#x27;Last year, switching careers stepped on a landmine and was almost ruined&#x27;, could you elaborate?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>&#x27;去年转行踩大雷几乎被搞垮&#x27;，方便细说下吗</details></li><li>Just saw it, how would an individual developer get into farming...

But in the future, if someone really wants to enter the farming industry, don&#x27;t just watch some videos, browse the market, and understand the market before starting. You must find a reliable insider to cooperate with. It&#x27;s probably just luck for a novice to not lose money.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@LiuJiang 楼上有说，跟计算机没关系，不过以后要是有人真想入行养殖，千万不要自己看点视频逛逛市场了解点行情就开始干，怎么也要找个靠谱的行内人合作，新手做到不赔也可能只是运气好</details></li><li>@LiuJiang It was still forced. Before AI programming became popular, I could still earn some income by taking orders, but after GPT Doubao and the like became popular, even college students&#x27; homework is rare.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@LiuJiang 还是被逼的，AI 编程火之前自己接单之类还可以有点收入，GPT 豆包之类的火了之后连大学生作业都很少了</details></li><li>@street000 Don&#x27;t narrow your path.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@street000 别把路走窄了</details></li><li>@digitalnomad222 That makes sense.

If you can get a project, employers will ruthlessly lower the price, and programmers will have fewer ways out.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@street000 #13 这类毕设、作业、外包类的，以后基本凉了，能接到项目都会被雇主狠狠压价，程序员又少了退路</details></li><li>Also looking for an Android job, the market is really too bad now.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>也是 Android 找工作中，现在行情确实太差了。</details></li><li>@guanhui07 Many people have mentioned HarmonyOS, it&#x27;s estimated that there&#x27;s still space. Also, in the Web front-end field, is project experience important? I know a little about the front-end and want to go deeper, but I&#x27;m afraid of being kicked out by those who graduated from big companies.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@guanhui07 很多人都提到鸿蒙，估计还有空间。还有请问 Web 前端这块看项目经验吗，前端懂点皮毛想深入怕被大厂毕业出来的一脚踢没</details></li>
