            <p>I am an individual developer with a tech stack of Java, Kotlin, and Compose. I worked as a full-time developer in 2021 and then switched careers. I have continued to follow Android development, and together, my Kotlin and Compose related libraries on GitHub have over a thousand stars. I consider my mastery of related technologies to be acceptable.

Last year, I switched careers and almost went bankrupt from a major pitfall, so I&#x27;m preparing to come back and continue developing. I looked at Boss Zhipin for a week, only applying for entry-level positions within Guangdong Province. I submitted almost 30 resumes, including some from outsourcing companies that actively asked for my resume. I didn&#x27;t expect to get a single interview. Is it because switching careers/having a long break is a major taboo, or is the internet client-side market really that cold?

Should I continue looking for Android jobs or switch careers? For example, switch to front-end React/NextJS? I am relatively familiar with these two, but I don&#x27;t have any enterprise project experience, so I really don&#x27;t know how to find a job. Moreover, with the maturity of tools like v0 and Cursor, will front-end be even more difficult than Android?

Please give me some guidance!</p>

                <p>鄙人散修，习Java、Kotlin、Compose之术。 二一年曾入世为码农，后转行。然仍心系安卓，GitHub之上，Kotlin、Compose相关小术亦得星千余，自诩略有所成。

去岁误入歧途，几近倾覆，欲重拾旧业。 遍览直聘，仅投粤地初阶之职，近三十余封简历，竟无一面！莫非转行/空窗日久，触犯天条？抑或当今客户端市场，已是严冬？

是否应续寻安卓机缘，抑或另辟蹊径？ 若转前端React/NextJS，略通皮毛，然乏企业项目历练，不知路在何方。且v0、Cursor之器日渐成熟，前端岂非更胜安卓之难？

还望诸位道友慷慨指点！</p>

                <li>Here&#x27;s my evaluation of HarmonyOS from 2023, which is still valid in 2025. Huawei&#x27;s phones for the market will continue to maintain a shell of the HarmonyOS system. NEXT is very unlikely to be pushed to the market. HarmonyOS has a large number of hundreds of millions of users, but it is a shell system mixed with Android. If OTA is upgraded to NEXT, Huawei cannot solve the problem of old applications. Android has millions of apps. If the upgrade is successful, hundreds of millions of users will not be able to use it directly. Relying on the few apps signed, there is no natural market driving force to support the ecology. Ordinary users see that Xiaohongshu has adapted to HarmonyOS and subconsciously feel that all Android functions have been migrated, and they even think that HarmonyOS&#x27;s package size is well optimized. This is actually impossible. Android has invested so much manpower to do the functions, and it is impossible to copy them all at once. In the end, only a few pages will be adapted. Most of the signed adaptations will eventually be an elderly streamlined express version of the app. And after they adapt, will they still iterate normally? I think most of them will be done after version 1.0 and there will be no follow-up.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>今呈二三年鸿蒙评鉴，至二五年仍作效用。华为手机，市面可见者，仍将维系套壳鸿蒙。NEXT推广堪忧。鸿蒙虽拥数亿用户，然实乃混杂安卓之套壳系统。若OTA升级至NEXT，华为无解旧应用之困。安卓百万应用，一经升级，数亿用户何所用？ 仅依签约寥寥数款应用，无自然市场推力，实难支撑生态。 凡人见小红书适配鸿蒙，潜意识以为安卓功能尽迁，更以为鸿蒙包体优化甚佳。然实不能也。安卓耗费巨大人力方成之功，岂能一蹴而就？终不过适配数页而已。 大部分签约适配者，终将沦为老人精简极速版。 且适配之后，是否仍常迭代？吾以为，多止于一点零版，便无下文矣。</details></li><li>The HarmonyOS market is far from as big as imagined. Most companies&#x27; HarmonyOS clients are just randomly assigned a few client colleagues, or directly outsourced. Once the function is done, it&#x27;s basically over, and there&#x27;s basically no follow-up maintenance, so it&#x27;s also difficult to find a job. I looked for a HarmonyOS job for more than half a month before, and found that the salary was low, there were few jobs, and most of them were gone after three months. Even if I didn&#x27;t tell you to do it for three months, most of them were laid off after a few months. There are too few HarmonyOS developers who provide stable positions.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>鸿蒙市场，远逊想象。诸公司鸿蒙客户端，不过抽调数名客户端同僚，或径行外包。功能既毕，便告终结，鲜有后续维护，故觅职维艰。 吾曾求职鸿蒙逾半月，察之薪俸低微，岗位稀少，且多三月即散。纵未明言三月之期，亦多数月遭裁。 鸿蒙开发，能供稳定之位者，甚少也。</details></li><li>It&#x27;s better to work on HarmonyOS than Android now, at least you can enjoy the red利 for a few years.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>与其安卓，不如鸿蒙，或可享红利数载。</details></li><li>What kind of career change did you make that stepped on a landmine?

It is difficult for the entire client and the front-end. It is recommended to learn HarmonyOS, and then develop in the direction of large front-end and AI.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>难矣，客户端、前端皆难。 荐习鸿蒙，再向大前端、AI方向精进。</details></li><li>@july1995 I understand, thank you for providing the information. With this market situation, it feels like it&#x27;s even harder for newbies to get started than to find Android jobs.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@july1995 明白了，感谢提供信息。 在这种市场行情下，感觉小白入门比找安卓工作还要难。</details></li><li>@TArysiyehua Thanks for the suggestion, it really feels like client-side is difficult. Most of the Android jobs I see are either cross-platform, hardware, or HarmonyOS, and I hardly see any Web jobs recruiting client-side developers. If I don&#x27;t consider going to the bottom layer, maybe there&#x27;s still some space in cross-platform and HarmonyOS.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@TArysiyehua 感谢建议，这样说确实感觉客户端都很难了，看到的大多安卓岗位要么跨端要么硬件要么鸿蒙，Web 也几乎没看到招客户端的。不考虑往底层走，可能只有跨端和鸿蒙还有点空间了。</details></li><li>&#x27;Last year, I switched careers and almost went bankrupt from a major pitfall&#x27;, can you elaborate?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>“去岁转行遇大坑”，可否详述？</details></li><li>I just saw it, how can an individual developer do farming...
