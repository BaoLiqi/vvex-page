        <div class="content">
            <p>My brother-in-law is 22 years old, currently a senior in college, and took the postgraduate entrance examination for computer science at the end of last year. He fainted once at the end of last year and was found to be anemic after going to the hospital for examination. When I went home for the New Year, I found that his complexion was sallow and his condition was not good. Starting from February 13th, he began to vomit after eating. We took him to the hospital for an enhanced CT scan, and the doctor told us that the examination results were not optimistic, and the tumor in the intestines had metastasized to the liver. He has now gone to a large hospital in Shanghai for pathological examination, and the final results are still pending.

My brother-in-law usually likes to eat stimulating foods, and the pressure of the postgraduate entrance examination is also very high. Long-term staying up late, smoking, and drinking strong coffee may all have an impact on his health.

I hope everyone can pay attention to it, have regular physical examinations, especially gastrointestinal endoscopy every 3-5 years, and maintain a good physical condition.</p>

                <p>吾内弟年方弱冠，肄业于学府。去岁末，尝试计算机科举，然气血凝滞，偶有昏厥之象，医者诊为贫血。归家省亲，见其面色蜡黄，精气神皆损。二月十三始，进食则呕，遂携至医院，以灵视(CT)观之，医者曰：‘不妙, 肠道顽疾已侵肝脏！’今已赴沪上大医处求诊，病理详验，佳音未至。

内弟素嗜辛辣之物，科举重压，常夜不寐，烟酒咖啡，诸般损身之习，皆为患病之因。

诫诸位道友，勤于体察自身，定期内视(体检)。尤以三五年间，照观肠胃(肠胃镜)，以保元气充盈。</p>

                <li>@Guidoo #4 Don&#x27;t mention the second tier, the top three hospitals in small places may not be reliable. I&#x27;ll directly name it: Shangluo Central Hospital, I just checked that it is top three. Before the New Year, a relative was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (bone marrow aspiration was done), and then told to go home and have a good New Year (meaning to prepare for the funeral). Guess what, after the New Year, he went to a large hospital in Xi&#x27;an (the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi&#x27;an Jiaotong University) for examination, and there was nothing wrong, just anemia. You said how badly people were harmed...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Guidoo #4 莫言二甲，小镇三甲亦难信也。直指商洛中心医院，查之，确为三甲。岁末，有亲眷被诊为急性髓细胞白血病（已行骨髓穿刺），遂令归家安心过年（实则准备后事）。孰料年后赴西安大医院（西安交大二附院）复查，竟无恙，仅为贫血。可谓害人不浅！</details></li><li>This age group has many people with this kind of lifestyle, but those with tumors are extremely rare. So I think your brother-in-law is just unlucky. Middle-aged people don&#x27;t need to worry about themselves. Of course, physical examination is right, but it is not for cancer, but for some other common diseases.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此年龄段，有此等习气者，比比皆是。然罹患顽疾者，实乃凤毛麟角。故吾以为，汝内弟运道不济耳。中年道友不必过虑，体察自身固是，然非为防癌，乃为其他常疾。</details></li><li>This is purely tragic. The recommended age for early cancer screening is 35-40 years old. He hasn&#x27;t reached the age for a large-scale physical examination, but the anemia was not further checked. Is the hospital so bad? For young people, anemia is treated with iron supplements? Must suspect is tumor anemia<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此乃纯粹之悲剧。早癌筛查，荐于三十五至四十岁。其尚未至大型体检之龄，然贫血未深究。医馆若此马虎乎？年轻人贫血，仅以铁剂敷衍？当疑是否为肿瘤所致之贫血。</details></li><li>In recent years, serious illnesses have become younger. Basically, it is because the immune system fails and cannot kill the very small amount of cancer cells that are produced in everyone&#x27;s body every day. 1. Busy work and high stress lead to poor rest. 2. The global health event a few years ago attacked the ability of the immune system. 3. Gene problems. I don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with eating and drinking stimulating foods and coffee. My wife has a regular life, exercises regularly, and eats fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and health-preserving diet throughout the year. Still got nasopharyngeal carcinoma for no reason.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>近年重疾年轻化，盖因免疫系统失灵，无力诛灭体内每日所生之微量癌细胞。一者，工作繁忙，压力山大，致使休息不佳。二者，数年前之环球瘟疫，损及免疫之能。三者，基因之祸。吾以为，与辛辣刺激之食物、咖啡无涉。吾妻作息规律，定时健体，终年茹素，食五谷杂粮，颐养天年。然终不明就里，罹患鼻咽癌。</details></li><li>Wow, so young. Makes me a little scared.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>噫！如此年少，令人胆寒。</details></li><li>@my101du #6 The global health event a few years ago attacked the immune system&#x27;s ability +1.

Take your wife and family for early cancer screening and gastroscopy.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>青年罹患重疾，多为基因之祸。生活习惯，乃充分非必要条件。携汝妻眷，行早癌筛查及内视(肠胃镜)之检。</details></li><li>@wanwaneryide Did you read carefully, the reason for anemia is a tumor, what does it have to do with eating well<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@wanwaneryide 汝有否细读？贫血之因，乃肿瘤所致，与食脍何干？</details></li><li>@Xhack He means that anemia at this age should be suspected, and further examination should be carried out<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Xhack 其意为：此年纪贫血，便当生疑，当行进一步之诊察。</details></li><li>@yn1024 Same feeling, I have been drifting in Shanghai for more than ten years. Regarding seeing a doctor, I only trust Shanghai and non-Shanghai hospitals. The Shanghai side feels very professional, and the top three and top two hospitals in my hometown are not very good. Family members and relatives have some problems that can&#x27;t be treated in their hometown, so they immediately come to Shanghai. I remember a postgraduate guidance teacher said that the doctors and teachers in small places are those students who didn&#x27;t study well back then, and they know their level. The awesome ones have been poached by big cities.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@yn1024 吾亦有同感，沪漂十余载，论及医诊，唯信上海与非上海之所。沪上医者，精专过人，吾乡三甲二甲，难孚众望。家眷亲友，若有疑难杂症，多来沪求医。忆昔考研导师曾云，小城医师，皆当年学业平平之辈，其能几何？贤才皆为大城所纳。</details></li><li>@fengfisher3 Advanced metastasis combined with treatment is basically within 1 year, my family has elders who passed away in less than 3 months from the time they were diagnosed. This kind of thing can only be enlightened to the parties&#x27; parents and elders, and the parties may be open-minded if they know.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@fengfisher3 顽疾晚期，兼以医治，延寿逾年者希。吾家有老者，自察至逝，不足三月。此事唯可开导病患之父母与长辈，当事人若知情，或可看破。</details></li><li>There is a doctor on Bilibili who even talks about kitchen hygiene... Every day before eating, the bowls, chopsticks, and spoons are scalded and scalded...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>B站有医者，竟言及厨下卫生…每日饭前对碗筷、汤匙，烫之复烫…</details></li><li>@murmur Indeed, you can&#x27;t even imagine it. The father-in-law took him to a secondary hospital near his home (about 500m away) to see the anemia. I, my wife, and them have told them many times that this hospital is not good! Not good! Not good! Because this hospital has had several medical accidents. You still have to go to a top three hospital to see a doctor.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@murmur 诚然，难以置信。岳父携其往家旁二级医馆（相距五百米）诊治贫血。吾、吾妻及彼等屡劝之，此馆医术不精！不精！不精！盖因其屡出医疗事故。仍需赴三甲求医。</details></li><li>@my101du What was said also makes sense<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@my101du 所言亦有理</details></li><li>@yn1024 Die and come back to life<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@yn1024 死去活来</details></li><li>Now you don&#x27;t have to take the postgraduate entrance examination<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>此番无需科考矣</details></li><li>So young, I feel that genetic factors account for a larger proportion<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>如此年轻，觉基因之因占比更大</details></li><li>@my101du Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is mainly caused by viruses<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@my101du 鼻咽癌主因乃病毒也</details></li><li>@my101du #6 The order is wrong, it should be 2 first, then 1, and finally 3.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@my101du #6 顺序有误，应先二，再一，后三也。</details></li><li>A male college student at 22 years old, these words together shouldn&#x27;t it be the best time for his body, anemia, I&#x27;m really curious where the money for eating has gone or is he not eating<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>学子年方廿二，正值鼎盛之期，竟患贫血，奇哉怪也？莫非饮食不周？</details></li>
