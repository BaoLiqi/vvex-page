            <h3>小舅子生病有感...</h3>

        <div class="content">
            <p>My brother-in-law is 22 years old this year and is a senior in college, preparing for the postgraduate entrance exam in computer science last year. He fainted once at the end of last year and was found to be anemic after a hospital check-up. When he went home for the Chinese New Year, we noticed that his complexion was sallow and his condition was poor. From February 13th, he started vomiting after eating. We took him to the hospital for an enhanced CT scan, and the doctor told us that the results were not optimistic, as the tumor in his intestines had metastasized to his liver. He has now gone to a large hospital in Shanghai for a pathological examination, and the final results are still pending.

My brother-in-law usually likes to eat spicy food, and he is under a lot of pressure from the postgraduate entrance exam. Long-term sleep deprivation, smoking, and drinking strong coffee, these bad habits may have an impact on his health.

I hope everyone can pay attention to their health, have regular check-ups, especially a gastroscopy and colonoscopy every 3-5 years, and maintain a good physical condition.</p>

                <p>小舅子今年 22 岁，正在读大四，去年底参加了计算机考研。去年底他曾晕倒一次，去医院检查后发现是贫血。过年回家时，发现他的脸色蜡黄，状态不佳。从 2 月 13 号起，他开始吃东西就呕吐。我们带他去医院做了增强 CT 检查，医生告诉我们检查结果不容乐观，肠道的肿瘤已经转移到肝脏。目前他已经去了上海的大医院做病理检查，最终结果还在等待中。

小舅子平时喜欢吃刺激性食物，考研压力也很大，长期熬夜、抽烟、喝浓咖啡，这些不良习惯都有可能对他的健康产生影响。

希望大家能够引起重视，定期体检，特别是每隔 3-5 年做一次肠胃镜，保持良好的身体状态。</p>

                <li>@Guidoo #4 Don&#x27;t even mention second-tier hospitals, even the top-tier hospitals in small places may not be reliable. I&#x27;ll name one directly: Shangluo Central Hospital. I just checked and it&#x27;s a top-tier hospital. They diagnosed a relative with acute myeloid leukemia (after a bone marrow aspiration) before the Chinese New Year and told them to go home and enjoy the New Year (meaning to prepare for their funeral). Guess what? After the New Year, a check-up at a major hospital in Xi&#x27;an (The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi&#x27;an Jiaotong University) found nothing wrong, just anemia. Can you believe how badly they screwed someone over...?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Guidoo #4 别说二级了，小地方的三甲都不一定靠谱，我直接点名了：商洛市中心医院，刚查了下是三甲，年前给一个亲戚确诊急性髓细胞白血病（做了骨髓穿刺），然后让回家好好过年（准备后事的意思），你猜怎么着，年后去西安大医院（西安交大二附院）一查，啥事没有，就是贫血，你说把人给坑的。。。</details></li><li>Many people of this age have these kinds of lifestyles, but having a tumor is definitely rare. So I think your brother-in-law is just unlucky. Middle-aged people don&#x27;t need to take it to heart. Of course, check-ups are good, but they are not only aimed at cancer, but also at other common diseases.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>这个年纪这种生活习惯的一抓一大把，但是有肿瘤的绝对是凤毛麟角，所以我认为你小舅子就是运气不好，中年人不用往自己身上带，当然体检这个是对的，只不过针对的不是癌症，而且其它一些常见的疾病。</details></li><li>This is purely tragic. Early cancer screening is currently recommended for ages 35-40. He hasn&#x27;t reached the age for a major physical examination, but he didn&#x27;t get further tested for anemia. Is the hospital so careless? They just gave iron supplements to a young person with anemia? You must suspect whether it is tumor-related anemia.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>这个是纯悲催，早癌筛查目前推荐的年龄是 35-40 岁，他这个还没到大型体检的年龄但是贫血没进一步检查，医院这么水的吗，年轻人贫血给补铁就打发了？一定要怀疑是不是肿瘤贫血</details></li><li>In recent years, serious illnesses are becoming younger, mainly because the immune system malfunctions and cannot kill the very small amount of cancer cells that are produced in everyone&#x27;s body every day. 1. Busy work and high pressure lead to insufficient rest. 2. The attack on the immune system by the global health event a few years ago. 3. Genetic issues. I don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with eating and drinking spicy food and coffee. My wife has a regular life, exercises regularly, and eats fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and health-preserving foods all year round. Still, she inexplicably got nasopharyngeal cancer.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>最近几年重病年轻化，基本上是因为免疫系统失灵，无法杀灭每个人体内每天都会产生的极少量癌细胞。1. 工作忙、压力大导致没有休息好。2. 前几年那个全球卫生事件对免疫系统能力的攻击。3. 基因问题。我感觉和吃喝刺激性食物、咖啡没有什么关系。我妻子生活规律，定时健身，一年到头吃水果蔬菜粗粮养生饮食。 还是莫名其妙得了鼻咽癌。</details></li><li>Wow, so young. It&#x27;s making me a little scared.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>我去，这么年轻。搞得我都有点怕了。</details></li><li>@my101du #6 The attack on the immune system by the global health event a few years ago +1 I got chickenpox at my old age...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@my101du #6 前几年那个全球卫生事件对免疫系统能力的攻击 +1我一大把年纪还发了水痘。。。</details></li><li>This is basically a genetic issue when you&#x27;re young, and lifestyle habits are a sufficient but not necessary condition. Take your wife and family for an early cancer screening and a gastroscopy and colonoscopy.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>这是年轻基本是基因的问题，和生活习惯的关系是充分但不必要条件拉上你老婆和家人做一次早癌筛查，以及肠胃镜检查</details></li><li>@wanwaneryide Did you read carefully? The cause of the anemia is the tumor. What does it have to do with eating well?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@wanwaneryide 有没有认真读，导致贫血的原因是肿瘤，和有没有好好吃饭啥关系</details></li><li>@Xhack He means that anemia at this age should be suspected and further examination should be carried out.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@Xhack 他的意思是，这个年级贫血就应该怀疑了，就应该进一步进行检查</details></li><li>@yn1024 I feel the same way. I&#x27;ve been working in Shanghai for more than ten years. When it comes to hospitals, I only consider Shanghai versus non-Shanghai. Shanghai feels very professional. The top-tier and second-tier hospitals in my hometown are not good. When family members and relatives have problems that can&#x27;t be cured in my hometown, they immediately come to Shanghai. I remember a postgraduate entrance exam instructor saying that the doctors and teachers in small places are those of his classmates who didn&#x27;t study well. They know their level. The talented ones have been poached by big cities.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@yn1024 同感，沪漂十多年了，关于看病医院，我只有上海和非上海。上海这边感觉非常专业，老家那边三甲二甲都不咋的，家人和亲戚遇到一些毛病老家看不好，都立马上来上海。想起某考研指导老师说的，小地方医生老师就是当年自己那些学习不咋的同学，他们什么水平自己心理有数。牛逼的，都被大城市挖走了。</details></li><li>@fengfisher3 Even with treatment, advanced metastasis is basically within 1 year. An elderly person in my family went from diagnosis to death in less than 3 months. In this kind of situation, we can only comfort the parents and elders involved. If the person involved knows, they probably have come to terms with it.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@fengfisher3 晚期转移配合治疗也基本 1 年以内，家里有老人从查出来到走就 3 月不到。这种事情只能开导当事人父母和长辈了，当事人知道的话估计都看开了。</details></li><li>There is a doctor on Bilibili talking about kitchen hygiene... scalding bowls, chopsticks, and spoons every time before eating...<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>B 站有个医生竟然说到厨房卫生。。。每天吃饭前把碗，筷子，汤匙是烫了又烫。。。</details></li><li>@murmur I really couldn&#x27;t have imagined it. My father-in-law took him to the second-tier hospital next to their home (about 500m away) for the anemia. My wife and I have told them many times that this hospital is not good! Not good! Not good! Because this hospital has had several medical accidents. You still have to go to a top-tier hospital.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@murmur 确实都想不到。老丈人带他去家旁边的二级医院（离家 500m 左右）看的贫血，那家二级医院我和我老婆和他们说过很多次了这家医院不行！不行！不行！因为这家医院出过好几次医疗事故。 还是得去三甲医院看。</details></li><li>@my101du makes sense too<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@my101du 说的也有道理</details></li><li>@yn1024 between life and death<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@yn1024 死去活来</details></li><li>No need to take the postgraduate entrance exam now<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>这下不用考研了</details></li><li>So young, it feels like genetic factors play a bigger role<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>这么年轻，感觉还是遗传因素占比更大</details></li><li>@my101du Nasopharyngeal cancer is mainly caused by viruses, right?<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@my101du 鼻咽癌主要是病毒原因吧</details></li><li>@my101du #6 The order is wrong, it should be 2, then 1, then 3.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>@my101du #6顺序错了吧，应该是先 2 ，再 1 ，最后 3 了。</details></li><li>A 22-year-old male college student, these words together shouldn&#x27;t describe someone in the best of health? Anemia, I&#x27;m really curious where the money for food went or if he just didn&#x27;t eat.<br><details><summary>Show Chinese Reply</summary>大学生 22 岁 男的，这几个词在一起 不应该是身体最好的时候嘛，贫血，真的好奇吃饭的钱花哪去了还是不吃饭</details></li>
