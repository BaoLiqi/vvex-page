        <h2>朋友准备裸辞，劝了无用</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>My friend is a female born in '98, graduated from a 211 university.
Currently working in the technology department of a bank. The workload is moderate, requiring overtime, but the pressure is not high. Overtime is due to the atmosphere. My friend has some technical aspirations, but everyone understands the bank's technology. Although there are new technologies, there are more old things. The current total package is around 300,000 yuan, but since she has always been a marginal person, a transparent figure, and the work assigned is not very important, her performance has been consistently rated as poor. This year, her salary was also cut by 10,000 yuan. If she is rated as poor again this year, she will be optimized, so she is very depressed. In addition, my friend also mentioned that she is not used to the workplace atmosphere in the bank, such as learning to actively express herself, ask for credit, etc., so she is considering finding another job.
My friend interviewed for an outsourcing position in a major Internet company and could get a 30% salary increase on the current income and do more technically related content, rather than doing more management-oriented work like in the bank, so she is very excited and plans to quit her job without a new one lined up and prepare for a while to see if there's any better opportunity.
I dissuaded her, thinking it would be more appropriate to look for a better job while still employed. But my friend wants to pursue her ideals, so I didn't try to persuade her further. Yuanfang, what do you think?</p>
            <p>朋友 98 年女生，某 211 大学毕业
目前在某银行科技部工作，工作强度中规中矩，需要加班，但是压力不大，加班是氛围导致，朋友是有点技术追求的，但是银行的技术大家懂的都懂，虽然新的技术有，但旧的东西偏多。目前总包在 30W 左右，但由于工作以来一直是边缘人角色，小透明，被分配的工作也不是非常重要，导致绩效一直被评差，今年还被降薪了 1W ，今年如果还被评差的话，就会被优化，于是心情倍受打击，此外朋友还提到不适应银行内的职场氛围，比如要学会主动表现自己，邀功之类的，遂考虑另寻高就。
朋友面试过某互联网大厂外包，能在目前的流水上涨薪 30%，也能做更偏向技术相关的内容，而不是和银行一样做管理偏多的工作，所以很心动，打算裸辞，再备战备战一段时间，观望一下更好的去处。
我劝阻了一下，觉得骑驴找马更合适。奈何朋友要追求自己的理想，所以没再多劝了。元芳，你怎么看</p>

In the end, I endured it for another year and still quit at the end of 2021. The main reasons were not related to income, but a combination of work content, technological development, interpersonal relationships, and other factors. In short, during my time at this unit, I experienced continuous hair loss, insomnia, and emotional depression. I left in November, enjoyed myself until after the New Year, paid for social security during this period, started looking for a job around February after the New Year, and joined a new company in March. The total package increased by about a quarter, and the most different thing was that my mood improved a lot, and my appetite also improved. One thing that no one has mentioned above is that because the market is declining, it is better to leave sooner rather than later. Even if it is difficult to find a job now, it is not impossible to find one. If you are optimized out in a few years, wouldn't it be even more difficult to find one? The original poster's friend is at risk of being optimized anyway, and it seems quite high. Of course, regardless of whether I listened to the advice or not, I knew that I was ultimately responsible. At that time, I decided to endure it for a year to see if there would be a turnaround in the institute. But occasionally I also feel that if I could have seen the situation more clearly and had the courage to argue with my family in 2020, wouldn't I have saved that year of suffering and wasted time? And the employment environment in 2020 was better. In addition, looking for a job while still employed is not suitable for everyone. It is already very tiring to work, and if you squeeze all your time after work to find a job, what kind of state will you be in? Of course, I don't rule out that some people have this ability.<br>我 2020 年在某航天研究所想裸辞，听了我爸的劝没辞。最后忍了一年 2021 年底还是辞了，主要原因和收入无关，是综合了工作内容、技术发展、人际关系等多方面原因，总之呆在这单位期间，持续性脱发、失眠、情绪抑郁。11 月走的，玩到过年后，这期间花钱交的社保，年后大概 2 月开始找工作，3 月份入职了新的公司，总包涨了四分之一左右，最不同的是人的心情好了不少，吃饭胃口都好了。有一点上面都没人提，正因为市场是下行的，如果要走的话还不如早点走。就算现在找工作难，也不是完全找不着，如果再过几年被优化出来，岂不是更难找？楼主朋友总归是有被优化风险的，而且看起来还不小。当然不管我听没听劝，我知道自己才是最终负责人，当时决定忍一年也是想看看在所里能不能有转机。但是偶尔也会觉得，如果自己当时更能看清现状 、更有魄力能够和家人据理力争，20 年就辞职出来，是不是不用白吃那一年苦、浪费一年时间，而且 20 年就业环境也更好点吧。另外骑驴找马对有的人并不合适，本来上班就很累，下班那点时间再全部挤占，你去找工作的时候能是个什么好状态呢？当然不排除一些人就是有这个能力。</li><li>Pursue<br>追</li><li>@jinksw Not very rich, just an average family.<br>@jinksw 倒也没有很有钱，普通家庭吧</li><li>Respect the fate of others, is it your turn to give pointers on other people's lives? As a friend, you can only offer a suggestion at most, and it's up to them whether to listen or not. Suppose listening to your advice causes her to lose the opportunity to go to a big factory and climb to a salary of 600,000 or even 800,000 a year, are you responsible for that?<br>尊重他人命运，别的人生轮得到你指点吗，作为朋友最多提一嘴建议，别人爱听不听。假设听你的建议让她损失了去大厂爬升到年薪 60 甚至 80 的机会，你负责吗？</li><li>Everyone has their own destiny, you can't control it.

It's not like they don't have a few months of savings, especially for people who haven't changed jobs in a few years. Their understanding of the entire market environment may still be from a few years ago. They think they can easily change jobs, a job change will definitely lead to a salary increase, and if I'm not wanted here, I'll be wanted elsewhere. The biggest problem with quitting without a job lined up is: rashly cutting off your own escape route! These people usually spend the first month playing around, the second month submitting resumes and finding that there are very few responses, and the third month starting to anxiously submit resumes in large quantities, and then reluctantly accepting a job that is not formally employed, with a salary cut, overtime, and a long commute. If you don't have money, you have to do this kind of job, and if you have money, even half a year of being unemployed is tough.<br>裸辞最大的问题不是钱，几个月的存粮不至于没有，尤其是对于几年没换工作的人，他们对于整个市场环境的认知可能还是几年前的，觉得还能随便换工作，跳槽必涨薪，此处不留爷，必有留爷处。裸辞最大的问题就是：贸然把自己后路给断了！这种人刚开始都是第一个月玩，第二个月投简历发现投简历回复寥寥无几，第三个月开始焦虑海投，然后不得已接受了一份，非正编，降薪，加班，通勤远的工作。如果你没钱你不得不去做这样的工作，如果你有钱，空窗半年也够呛。</li><li>Giving advice is okay, just know when to stop; can the people upstairs say they've never given advice to anyone?
